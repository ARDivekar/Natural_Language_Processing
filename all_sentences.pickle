S"Sometime in the middle of July 2012, a mid-level Infosys employee sent an email to media houses listing out the reasons for her frustration over what's going on in the company."
p1
aS'The reason for her angst was a series of pro-Infosys articles, which she felt were hopelessly out of touch with reality.'
p2
aS'The email mentioned, among other things, a culture of entitlement (as opposed to meritocracy); internal people being bypassed for promotions and getting no increments, while outsiders were being recruited at high salaries; an opaque system wherein the information flow from senior management is virtually non-existent; and a skewed compensation structure wherein sales people were at a huge advantage over their software development counterparts.'
p3
aS'The executive, who has since left the company, had requested that she remain unnamed.'
p4
aS"The lady is surely feeling vindicated now since her analysis of the Infosys work culture at that time has an uncanny resemblance to what N R Narayana Murthy said last week at the company's annual general meeting."
p5
aS'She was bang on even about the last point.'
p6
aS'As Murthy said, entry-level sales people were starting with a 10 to 12 years advantage over entry-level software people.'
p7
aS'The extraordinary speech should be a case study of how a company, once known for its path-breaking human resources (HR) practices, allowed things to degenerate.'
p8
aS"While the speech pointed out many loopholes in the system and how things have been or are being put back on track, the most significant was Murthy's admission that Infosys did dilute meritocracy and accountability in the last decade."
p9
aS"That's damning for a company which was once at the forefront of India's knowledge economy."
p10
aS'Many are looking at this as self-criticism as well.'
p11
aS"And that's because the leadership vacuum, which led to many of these problems, was caused by Murthy himself."
p12
aS'He was the one who propounded the flawed philosophy that leadership had to be rotated through the co-founders.'
p13
aS"For a globally competitive company, reserving the CEO chair for a select group only served to choke Infosys' talent pipeline since the meritorious knew they could never make it to the top job in the company."
p14
aS"The situation worsened as the management lived in self-denial, blaming the market for all of Infosys' struggles, even though competition prospered in the same market."
p15
aS'There is no doubt that Infosys became arrogant, overconfident (the management started thinking they had customers in their pockets for life) and self-absorbed by its past success and hence, in many ways did not advance organisationally and culturally like some of its peers.'
p16
aS'As a result, many employees started seeing it as a sweatshop, relying more on commodity business and increasing its focus on offsite rather than higher margin onsite business.'
p17
aS'The appointment of its first non-founder CEO would hopefully help Infosys get back to the good old days of meritocracy.'
p18
aS'But it would be a long haul since moving from a culture of entitlement to a culture of merit takes time and courage.'
p19
aS"Entitlement, as described by Judith Bardwick in her book 'Danger In The Comfort Zone', is an attitude where people in authority believe they do not have to earn what they get."
p20
aS'In a culture of entitlement, peer pressure to perform is supplanted by peer pressure to conform; and companies and institutions that believe in a culture of entitlement often see the strong being weakened to strengthen the weak.'
p21
aS'The main task for the new management at Infosys, therefore, is to bring meritocracy back into the system, which mandates that the strongest people in the workplace be fully supported and leveraged, and weak people weeded out.'
p22
aS'For meritocracy to come back into the system, one of the prerequisites is to give employees the tools, coaching, support and leadership to make the transition.'
p23
aS'In his speech, Murthy has detailed a few such initiatives he has taken after his return as executive chairman.'
p24
aS"One of the most significant steps that got buried under the attention-grabbing headlines was Murthy's move to build a sophisticated system to measure the productivity of software engineers - a first in India's information technology industry."
p25
aS'The move indeed has the potential to transform Infosys at the fundamental level since it would help a software engineer to see on a daily basis how productive he or she is with respect to the rest of the team.'
p26
aS"The move to encourage technical competence - through measures such as creating a separate stream for excellent code writers and revising the career path for excellent technology architects - and a more robust education and re-training programme for engineers given the rapid changes in technologies, would surely play a critical role to encourage meritocracy in a sector where a lot of skills are still considered to be intangible and, therefore, can't be measured."
p27
aS"In short, Murthy's speech is an absorbing study on how great companies can be hurt if the right decisions are not taken and people are not empowered enough."
p28
aS'Over to Vishal Sikka.'

aS'In the first quarter of FY15, sales were a disappointment, with dollar revenue growing 1.9 per cent over a quarter and seven per cent over a year, to $2.13 billion.'
p62
aS'However, it managed to prevent margins from declining sharply, despite the impact of wage rises and a stronger rupee.'
p63
aS'The operating margin declined 40 basis points to 25.1 per cent, against a decline of 200-230 bps anticipated by analysts.'
p64
aS'A large part of the margin surprise was driven by higher utilisation, excluding trainees.'

p94
aS'"Employee attrition rates are worrisome and we are implementing various initiatives to retain good talent," said the company\'s COO Pravin Rao.'
p95
aS'Shibulal said the company "listened hard to employees" and found that they were more interested in a predictable salary and career growth than in the level of the annual increment.'
p96
aS'"So even as we have given increments, we have reduced the variable pay and moved to quarterly promotions to support employees\' career growth.'
p97
aS'We promoted 7,500 employees last quarter," he said.'

p99
aS'The operating margin, which had dropped precipitously in 2011-12 and 2012-13 but which had been rising steadily last year, has once again fallen back.'
p100
aS'It is 25.1% in the June quarter, compared to 25.5% in the March quarter.'
p101
aS'The fall is partially on account of the salary increment effective April.'
p102
aS'But the operating margin would have been worse but for a 1.1 percentage point increase on account of a change in the way the company estimates the useful life of assets - which increased the life of the assets and consequently impacted depreciation levels.'
p103
aS'Rajiv Bansal, CFO, said the company improved operational performance due to its cost optimization initiatives and a focus on increasing productivity and utilization.'

Gopalakrishnan, Infosys experienced the worst period in its history, missing its own revenue forecasts several times, conceding market share to rivals like Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and in the process, giving up its prized crown of the bellwether of Indias $118-billion information technology industry.'

aS'We are (however) more predictable now than we have been in the recent past, said Shibulal, maintaining that Infosys is in a much stronger position now than it was when he took over the reins of the company.'
p135
aS'The most important thing to remember is that all of these challenges which are Infosys-specific and internal are all behind us, Shibulal said.'
p136
aS'Last year, the company reached a $34 million settlement to end a US investigation related to the alleged practice of flying workers to client sites in the US on temporary visas, he noted.'

aS'We are more predictable now than we have been in the recent past, said Shibulal, who is also the only Infosys founder to have briefly left the company to work for a different company (Sun Microsystems Inc.) before returning.'
p197
aS'The most important thing to remember is that all of these challenges, which are Infosys-specific and internal, are all behind us, Shibulal said.'
p198
aS'Last year, the company reached a $34 million settlement to end a US investigation related to the alleged practice of flying workers to client sites in the US on temporary visas, he noted.'

aS'...we have closed off other cases and won many of them, we have completed the transition to 3.0, we have completed the leadership transition...we have put a very strong foundation in place, he said.'
p200
aS'Infosys is facing a challenge of double-digit attrition, which many believe could rise further in the next quarter (July-September) before peaking out.'
p201
aS'According to experts, the high attrition is a reflection of business-related challenges at the company, and the senior exits over the last one year.'
p202
aS'During April-June 2014 (Q1FY2015), Infosys saw exits of 10,627 professionals, even more than the total employee base of mid-size Indian information technology (IT) services companies.'
p203
aS"At the end of the April-June quarter, the company's total headcount was 161,284."
p204
aS'Attrition rate during the quarter was 19.5 per cent, the highest Infosys has seen in its 33 years of existence.'
p205
aS"Infosys' attrition during January-March 2014 was 18.7 per cent, higher than 11.3 per cent at Tata Consultancy Services, 15.1 per cent (voluntary trailing - ten-month basis) at Wipro and 16.9 per cent at HCL Technologies."
p206
aS'Calling it "worrisome", Infosys\' Chief Operating Officer U B Pravin Rao said the Bangalore-based company was implementing initiatives to retain good talent and reduce attrition.'
p207
aS'Last year when the attrition had initially started picking up, Infosys had given out mid-year salary increments to employees.'
p208
aS'But this did not help much.'
p209
aS'Chief Executive Officer S D Shibulal said the company had "tried very hard to listen to the employees", to solve the issues leading them to quit.'
p210
aS'"We realised that the concerns were not about compensation," Shibulal said.'
p211
aS'"They were more about predictability, career growth, and variable component, which our employees said was a huge part of their salary.'
p212
aS'We have brought down the variable compensation considerably across the board."'
p213
aS'He said the company has started communicating with its employees to bring more clarity to them.'
p214
aS'"On predictability, we have done everything as scheduled in six to eight months.'
p215
aS'The schedules for compensation and promotion were delivered," he said.'
p216
aS'Infosys gave 7,500 promotions during April-March.'
p217
aS'The company has decided to have quarterly appraisals, Shibulal said.'
p218
aS'"Promotion is a reflection of growth.'
p219
aS'Our growth created opportunities for our people to go up in the career track," he said.'
p220
aS'The company has also started training for its employees to re-tool them on new and coming technologies.'
p221

p248
aS"Asked if there was a timeline to see a turnaround at Infosys, Kamath said the country's second largest software services firm was a profitable company."
p249
aS'"Actually if you look at it, Infosys is a very profitable company so there is no turnaround per se.'

aS'It is basically to get the top line as it were ticking at a faster pace than it was earlier," he added.'
p251
aS'The 33rd annual general meeting of Information technology (IT) services major Infosys, held here on Saturday, was a landmark one, as six of the 11 board members, who addressed shareholders, would not be on the panel anymore.'

aS"While the mood of bidding a sullen goodbye was prevalent even at Infosys' 30th AGM in 2011, when Murthy had retired (only to return to the company two years later to aid it tide over tough times), the Saturday's AGM, which was attended by over 400 shareholders, saw a high degree of maturity in accepting the development."

p274
aS'Both tasks, I was assigned, have been completed\nN R Narayana Murthy, Executive Chairman\nThe journey has been mostly positive with some bumps along the way.'
p275

p276
aS'I can honestly say that we have tried our best every single day\nKris Gopalakrishnan, Executive vice-chairman\nI have worn multiple hats in the organisations in the past 33 years...I have cherished each of one these roles.'
p277

aS'I have learnt far more than words can express"\nJeffrey S Lehman, Independent director (Completing term in April 2015 and stepping down)\n\r\nYet another shareholder who introduced himself as Srinivas Rao said having a Punjabi (Sikka) at the top would make the company more aggressive.'
p279
aS'"I really admire the selection of the new CEO.'
p280
aS'I have been following CEOs of many companies, so I find Punjabis are very aggressive as compared conservative south Indians.'
p281
aS'For example, HUL is ruled by Punjabis; so definitely I find a great future for Infosys and the new CEO," said Rao.'

aS'New Delhi:\nJack Palmer, a former employee of Infosys Ltd whose complaints in 2011 against alleged visa fraud ultimately resulted in the US government imposing a hefty $34 million fine on the company, filed a fresh complaint against the Bangalore-based firm for alleged wrongful termination.'
p285
aS'According to a report by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Palmer filed a fresh complaint with the US Department of Labor in May.'
p286
aS'According to the report, Palmer has alleged that Infosys and eight of its top executives had retaliated against him by denying him work, bonuses and promotions, and ultimately terminated his employment.'
p287
aS'Mint could not independently verify the contents of the latest complaint.'
p288
aS'Neither Infosys, nor Palmers lawyers, have responded to emails and phone calls seeking comment.'
p289
aS'The latest complaint against Infosys comes less than a year after the software services exporter was forced to cough up a $34 million fine for the alleged visa fraud.'
p290
aS'Infosys, on its part, vehemently denied the allegations, but conceded that it failed to maintain accurate immigration recordsknown as I-9 recordsfor many of its US employees in 2010 and 2011 as required by law.'
p291
aS'I-9 forms are used by a company to verify employee identities and establish that they are eligible to be employed in the US.'
p292
aS'Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse.'
p293
aS'Those claims are untrue and are assertions that remain unproven.'
p294
aS'The companys use of B-1 visas was for legitimate business purposes and not in any way intended to circumvent the requirements of the H-1B programme.'
p295
aS'Only .02% of the days that Infosys employees worked on US projects in 2012 were performed by B-1 visa holders, the company had said in October last year.'
p296
aS'The fine ultimately also led to the US government increasing scrutiny on other Indian information technology (IT) companies that have a large number of employees on work visas in the US at customer locations.'
p297
aS'Palmers latest complaint also comes when Infosys is in the middle of the largest management transition in its 33-year history.'
p298
aS'In July, Infosys named former SAP AG global product head Vishal Sikka as its first non-founder chief executive.'

aS'Narayana Murthy had relinquished his executive powers on 14 June.'
p301
aS'Sikka will take over the reins of Infosys on 1 August.'

aS'The company is also grappling with a top-level exodus that has seen more than a dozen senior-level executives leave the company over the past 12 months.'
p303
aS'Palmers lawsuit in 2011 is not the only one that has been filed against Infosys over the last few years.'
p304
aS'Last year, a US-based IT professional called Brenda Koehler filed a lawsuit against Infosys, alleging that the company had discriminated against job applicants in the country by preferring to hire workers from South Asia to fill positions in the US.'
p305
aS'In December 2012, a US court had dismissed the lawsuit filed by Satya Dev Tripuraneni, a former US employee of Infosys, who also had alleged visa fraud against Infosys.'
p306
aS'Call it a wise move or a calculated gamble, but Bangalore-based information technology major Infosys is set on a new chapter in its history with the adoption of a model that supports two power centres under the chief executive officer (CEO) and the chief operating officer (COO).'
p307
aS'The CEO-COO model is certainly not new to Infosys - such a structure was in place till two years ago.'
p308
aS"However, this will be the first time that both officials are going to be men who did not play a role in the company's founding."
p309
aS'Additionally, while the CEO is a complete outsider, the COO is a 28-year veteran of Infosys.'
p310
aS'Looking at the credentials and expertise of Vishal Sikka, incoming CEO of the company, and UB Pravin Rao, COO, experts and industry leaders believe that this could prove a "deadly combination", provided the two get along.'
p311
aS'Kavil Ramachandran, professor of family business and wealth management at the Indian School of Business, compares the CEO-COO model to a doubles game in tennis.'
p312
aS'"I think by opting for this model, the Infosys committee is making sure it is not taking any undue risk.'
p313
aS'It is ensuring that there is one person who is aware of the business background to run the day-to-day operations, while the other gets acquainted with the company\'s value and culture," he says.'
p314
aS'"However, this is like a doubles game where the understanding between these two players has to be perfect and bereft of ego clashes."'
p315
aS'Everyone is looking at how well the two men relate to each other as the new leaders of Infosys.'
p316
aS'"I think the model that the company has chosen is good.'
p317
aS'It is the implementation that we are worried about," says Sudin Apte, CEO and research director, Offshore Insights.'
p318
aS'"Sikka seems a CEO for the long term, someone who is not yet ready to take on the responsibility of day-to-day operations.'
p319
aS'Hence, a strong COO will be running the show.'
p320
aS'My concern is that those who formulated the model are all leaving.'
p321
aS'This is a high-stake model."'
p322
aS'Though the CEO-COO model has delivered for Infosys in the past, the company is currently faced with some peculiar issues, such as shrinking market share and declining profitability.'
p323
aS'For the two top executives, the task, therefore, is going to be a balancing act between transforming Infosys from an IT services company into a strategy-led technology player and focusing on delivering quarter-on-quarter results.'
p324
aS'Even as Sikka, who will formally take over from incumbent CEO S D Shibulal on August 1, is widely accepted as an ace technocrat, several observers have concerns about the lack of exposure he has in IT services.'
p325
aS'This is what is creating apprehension in the minds of investors and client.'
p326
aS'"Sikka is a good choice considering IT services are increasingly becoming software-driven or have software-like characteristics in the digital or SMAC (social, mobile, analytics, cloud) age.'
p327
aS'Having been the chief technology officer at an innovative software firm, Sikka can probably appreciate the changing technology paradigm and articulate business models therein, which is a positive," says Viju George in a J P Morgan report.'
p328
aS'"However, our concern is that Sikka has been focused more on the research & development or product development and has presumably not handled large profit and loss (accounts) or operations.'
p329
aS'Products, platforms and solutions accounts for less than 6 per cent of Infosys\'s revenues, while 94 per cent is traditional IT services."'
p330
aS"While some observers feel that Sikka's appointment will not hamper Infosys' recovery, there are others who demur."
p331
aS'Ramachandran belongs to the former category.'
p332
aS'He says, "I think the fact that Sikka has been given enough legroom to operate means he is clearly focused on strategy.'
p333
aS'He may go in for inorganic growth considering the company has enough cash on its books.'
p334
aS'These may be small in size but something which may become new businesses for Infosys in the future."'
p335
aS'However, George writes: "Infosys\'s recovery might get delayed as Sikka will take some time to understand Infosys.'
p336
aS"Being an outsider, he would likely take time to figure out Infosys's issues, its culture, ways of working, politics, competitive landscape, the onerous task of rebuilding a team - all of which will take time to show results (given Infosys's size)."
p337
aS"We believe Infosys's expected recovery to industry-level revenue growth by FY16E will likely get pushed out further (maybe to FY17E or even beyond)."
p338
aS'All in all, we believe the company will take a longer-than-earlier expected time to get back to respectable growth trajectory."'

p346
aS'A CEO-COO structure is much better than a dual-CEO one."'
p347
aS'Even as Rao will be the more hands-on operations person, Sikka will be seen as the man to bring back the focus on Infosys 3.0 (focus on product platforms and solutions), which has been put on the back burner for the past year but is widely seen as the way forward for IT service companies.'
p348
aS'He will have to also oversee a major team building exercise across the company.'

aS'Infosys continued to gain ground on Wednesday, surging about two per cent in intra-day trade to Rs 3,608, a five-month high.'

aS'The rise follows former chief financial officers (CFOs) T V Mohandas Pai and V Balakrishnan, along with former senior vice-president D N Prahlad, writing to the companys board to immediately consider a Rs 11,200-crore buyback of shares.'
p391
aS'The suggested buyback price of Rs 3,850, a 52-week high, is at a 6.7 per cent premium to Wednesdays intra-day high and about 10 per cent higher than Tuesdays closing price.'
p392
aS'If implemented, the buyback will be a first at Infosys since the company was listed in 1993.'
p393
aS'As of June 30, Infosys had about Rs 30,000 crore in cash and equivalents.'
p394
aS'Saurabh Mukherjea, chief executive (institutional equities), Ambit Capital, says, The company has surplus cash and a lot of market participants, including us, through the last three-four years have maintained if Infosys wants to see its stock price go up, it needs to return some of this cash to shareholders, and buyback is one of the most efficient ways of this...My understanding is several institutional investors have written to the company in the past, requesting for a buyback.'
p395
aS'However, so far, the management has not been yielding in its desire to offer a buyback.'
p396
aS'Our hope is the new CEO will take a more liberal and progressive view of its capital structure and realise it is holding ample cash.'
p397
aS'Infosys, however, feels the high level of cash is an important tool to weather tough times.'
p398
aS'In his interaction with the media soon after taking charge as chief executive earlier this month, Vishal Sikka had reiterated this.'
p399
aS'While experts suggest clarity on what the company intends to do with the cash pile generated through the years will be a positive, they dont expect the company to announce a buyback or a one-time dividend immediately.'
p400
aS'I lean in favour of former Infosicians.'
p401
aS'Though the company ought to spell out whether an acquisition is on the anvil or whether it will opt for a buyback, we need to give the new CEO reasonable time, say, a quarter or so to spell out his strategy.'
p402
aS'The issue, I feel, has become complicated due to a change in management.'

aS'We are bullish on the stock and think it could appreciate to Rs 4,040 in 12-15 months.'

p405
aS'Through the past few sessions, the stock has been gaining in anticipation of a buyback.'
p406
aS'However, if there is no buyback, it could correct from current levels, analysts say.'
p407
aS'Questions have always been raised on how Infosys will utilise its cash pile.'
p408
aS'Even in core fundamentals, it has been lagging TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) and HCL Technologies.'
p409
aS'The stock could correct in case a buyback or an acquisition doesnt come through, as some investors would have bought anticipating this.'
p410
aS'However, we remain bullish on Infosys, at it is available at reasonable valuations, says Mayuresh Joshi, vice-president (institutional), Angel Broking.'
p411
aS'Even as the analysts support demands for a buyback, many in the market are wondering on the timing of the letter.'
p412
aS'Interestingly, neither Pai nor Balakrishnan had favoured shareholders demands for share buybacks during their respective stints as CFO.'
p413
aS'The last has definitely not been said on this issue, with Infosys sitting on an eye-popping cash pile of Rs 30,000 crore.'
p414
aS'Bangalore: In one of his first acts as chief executive of Infosys Ltd, Vishal Sikka has made staff retention one of his top priorities and rolled out about 5,000 new promotions across the company as part of the drive, amid increasing attrition at Indias second largest software services exporter, where one out of every five employees leave the company every quarter.'
p415
aS'At a town hall last week after taking over, Sikka had said that the company would promote and redesignate about 5,000 employeesall part of a move to ensure that Infosys regains its former stature of being an employer of choice for thousands of engineering graduates across the country.'

aS'In June last year, Infosys Public Services, a subsidiary of Infosys in the US, had bagged this $49.5-million contract from the District of Columbia.'

aS'The contract included designing and building the IT infrastructure to support the Washington DC Health Benefit Exchange, an online shopping centre for health insurance created under ACT.'
p440
aS'In her civil lawsuit, filed late last year, Bolten has claimed she was harassed because she was not Indian and excluded from work-related conversations by supervisors, who spoke in Hindi.'
p441
aS'Bolten has also claimed that people with less experience than her were promoted ahead of her; this is why she eventually quit Infosys.'
p442

p450
aS'In the new complaint with the US Department of Labor in May, Palmer alleged Infosys and eight of its executives denied him work, bonuses and promotions and later terminated him.'
p451
aS'Three years ago, too, Palmer had sued Infosys in an Alabama state court accusing the company of harassment and breach of contract after he raised concerns about possible visa violations by the firm.'
p452
aS'That case was subsequently dismissed by a US district judge court on the ground there was "no basis to support any of the charges filed by Palmer".'
p453
aS'Additionally, in an interesting development in August last year, a prospective American candidate had filed a lawsuit against Infosys after failing to qualify for a job, alleging the company had discriminated against the US job applicants in favour of candidates from South Asia.'
p454
aS'In the lawsuit filed in a US District Court, Brenda Koehler, a Wisconsin-based IT professional with about 17 years of experience alleged Infosys ignored her qualifications and eventually hired a Bangladeshi worker to fill a position she was qualified for.'
p455
aS'Last year, Infosys had paid $34 million (Rs 204 crore) for civil settlement of a US visa misuse case.'
p456
aS'Despite the hefty payment, the company was asked by the US authorities to retain an independent third-party auditor at its expense to review its visa compliance until 2015.'
p457
aS"The independent auditor would be responsible for annually reviewing and reporting on Infosys' compliance with Form I-9, a type of employee documentation."
p458
aS'These reports would be given to the US attorney, Infosys had said in its annual report for 2013-14.'

p469
aS'You feel flattered, but you tend to gain fat as well," Infosys\' new managing director and chief executive officer jokes during a lunch he hosted for the media on his first day in office on August 1.'
p470
aS'But Sikka seems to have already found a way to control the after-effects of all this pampering.'
p471
aS'A colleague recounts his experience of finding himself far away from the office while discussing something with Sikka.'
p472
aS"That's because the CEO has this habit of walking for miles to work out a strategy, often taking along colleagues with him."
p473
aS'"I am now wiser.'
p474
aS'Infosys has a 170-acre complex.'
p475
aS'I would better have my walking shoes on before meeting him," the colleague says, with a smile.'
p476
aS"Shedding the flab, however, is the least of the challenges that the 47-year-old PhD in computer science from Stanford University faces as he begins his innings as Infosys' first non-founder CEO."
p477
aS'The real problem is getting Infosys out of the widespread perception that it has lost its plot and is in a crisis-like situation - something that forced NR Narayana Murthy to come back from retirement before handing over the baton to Sikka.'
p478
aS'Though the numbers have improved somewhat, the fact is that the 33-year-old company has lost its bellwether status to Tata Consultancy Services in the last couple of years.'
p479
aS'Worse, it has been overtaken in profit and revenue by Cognizant, and even HCL Technologies is giving it a hot chase.'
p480
aS"For 2014-15, Infosys' revenue guidance is much below that of industry body Nasscom's."
p481
aS"Infosys' employee attrition hit a record high of 19.5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2014-15 and the company has lost more than 10 senior executives in the last one year."
p482
aS'The other question of course is how the 160,000 Infoscions, especially the senior and middle-level employees, would react to the transition to an outsider CEO.'
p483
aS'Will investors continue to have patience with the new management for long?'
p484
aS'The man himself is trying his best to play down expectations by saying Infosys could do without the "intense scrutiny".'
p485
aS'"The results that you see now are the results of activities that were done quarters or even in some cases years ago.'
p486
aS'Therefore, no matter what we do now will be reflected on our results after a certain amount of time," Sikka says.'
p487
aS'Others agree about the challenge Infosys faces in acceptance of the new CEO.'
p488
aS'"From a cultural perspective, Infosys is a \'deeply inwardly\' focused organisation, and what Sikka brings in is an outsider approach.'
p489
aS'But that will be healthy for Infosys as the new CEO will bring a fresh perspective and a customer-oriented perspective," says Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder & CEO, Everest Group.'
p490
aS'Focus back on employees\r\nSikka says he is deeply aware of the "emotional attachment" that many employees still have with the founders, all of whom have left the organisation for the first time and his first task would be to assuage their concerns.'
p491
aS'But he believes what Andy Grove, the founder of Intel (Sikka was once an intern at the chip-maker), once said about founders of iconic companies: "Founders\' instincts should be institutionalised through processes".'
p492
aS"That's easier said than done as the old instincts are still strong."
p493
aS'For example, one of the first few things he did even before taking charge was to reach out to senior-level employees and ask them to show him the best software codes they have written.'
p494
aS'While he wanted to have a first-hand experience of the kind of work Infosys did in the past, his move had an opposite effect.'
p495
aS'Many of the employees reached out to their friends and former colleagues and even recruitment firms assuming that perhaps their days are numbered.'
p496
aS'It took lengthy discussions before employees were convinced about the real reason.'
p497
aS'Infosys, thus, has big plans for employee engagement to make a break from the overhang of the larger-than-life presence of the founders.'
p498
aS'Srikantan Moorthy, HR head of Infosys, says Sikka\'s "endearing personality" would help break the ice faster.'
p499
aS'But Sikka obviously wants a more tangible demonstration effect and that is why the company has started an initiative, called Murmuration, to crowdsource ideas from all employees in significant areas of operation.'
p500
aS'Murmuration is a word used to describe a flock of starlings, a species of birds that is highly social - hence the relevance to crowdsourcing.'
p501
aS'The idea has worked as 2,400 substantive ideas have already come in, which Sikka and Praveen Rao, the chief operating officer, would personally look at.'
p502
aS'"I believe in Rabindranath Tagore\'s servant-leader model.'
p503
aS'No one man can have monopoly over innovation anymore," Sikka says.'
p504
aS'He is also engaging with the employees quite vigorously through town-hall meetings and blogs, and wants to take classes regularly - both the online and physical versions.'
p505
aS'The CEO as a brand\r\nHis global brand equity is perhaps the greatest thing Sikka has brought in apart from his intellectual prowess.'
p506
aS'He is known in the C-suites of all leading global companies and when he talks, people all over the world take him seriously.'
p507
aS'He would have to become a visible standard bearer for the Infosys brand, something that the Indian IT services companies need at the level of maturity they are at, long-time Infosys watchers say.'
p508
aS'Many experts agree that what Infosys actually needed was not a CEO who is a master sales person but someone who has a strong brand recall.'
p509
aS'And in all these categories, Sikka supersedes many of his counterparts in Indian companies.'
p510
aS'The management change at Infosys signifies many things, says Harish Bijoor, a well-known brand and business strategy specialist.'
p511
aS'One of the big things is the fact that Infosys is moving on to become a Silicon Valley-based leadership from the earlier Bangalore club, he says.'
p512
aS'Besides, Infosys has brilliantly revived the earlier CEO-COO model.'
p513
aS"While Rao, an Infosys veteran would be his second-in-command and would manage the day-to-day operations and 'manage the show' in his absence, Sikka would himself focus on Americas and Europe, which account for 90 per cent of the software major's revenue."
p514
aS'He would of course spend a week every month in India.'
p515
aS"According to Sudin Apte, CEO and research director of advisory firm Offshore Insights, the new model under Sikka may gradually evolve like the 'Nandan (CEO) - Kris (COO)' format wherein all the delivery and sales organisation will report to the COO."
p516
aS'"Sikka will be the external face to clients, will make Infosys visible at various avenues and platforms, create its \'thought leader\' image and will be expected to work as a rainmaker to get the deals inflow," Apte says.'
p517
aS"Intellectual property all the way\r\nWhile these are still early days and the new leadership will take some time to frame out the specifics of its new strategy, one thing is crystal clear: Sikka is not going to change the founders' focus upside down."
p518
aS'Rather, he would focus more on products, platforms and intellectual property (IP) creation.'
p519
aS'"Many people ask me, \'Are you going to help Infosys into becoming a product company?\''
p520
aS'They miss the point.'
p521
aS'We will continue to be a services company, but bring in the efficiency of intellectual property into services business," says Sikka.'
p522
aS"It is not a particularly new strategy for India's second largest IT services provider."
p523
aS'Infosys 3.0 (this is the second year of the implementation of that strategy) was primarily aimed at growing the non-linear revenue stream and position the company away from the commoditised services.'
p524
aS'But the plan could not click due to the changing requirements of the clients on the back of the global slowdown in spending.'
p525
aS"That was the reason why one of the first things Murthy did after returning to the company as the executive chairman in June last year was to bring back focus on the company's 'bread and butter' application development and maintenance business, a low-hanging fruit which is primarily based on labour arbitrage."
p526
aS"Everest's Bendor-Samuel, however, says Sikka's appointment is a clear indication that Infosys will go back to its emphasis on IP, instead of just labour arbitrage-led businesses."
p527
aS'"Given his pedigree, the IP space would certainly drive growth and profitability going forward," he says.'
p528
aS"Sikka doesn't disagree with that view."
p529
aS'He clearly has plans that are radically different from the way Infosys ran all this while.'
p530
aS'And if implemented, this is going to fundamentally change the way Indian IT services companies serve the clients.'
p531
aS"To start with, Sikka has serious reservations about the whole concept of 'staff augmentation' wherein clients hire resources from service providers to do the work their existing team has been doing."
p532
aS'But the very fabric of that business has been laid on cost saving.'
p533
aS'"To me, it\'s very depressing for IT companies to say we will do whatever you were doing but more cheaply.'
p534
aS'I think it\'s about doing more than what was being done before - bringing more to it, being innovative," Sikka says.'
p535
aS'For example, he wants to focus more on "staff amplification" whereby end-users (clients) become more powerful and can do more what they are capable of.'
p536
aS'He talks about the huge opportunities in oil and gas, retail and automobiles.'
p537
aS'Think about the number of car breakdowns all over the world, he says.'
p538
aS'They are an expensive proposition as you have to call the mechanic, get it repaired and waste a lot of time.'
p539
aS"That's a huge opportunity as we can help clients by offering predictive maintenance solutions."
p540
aS'There is more.'
p541
aS'Infosys, as a part of its infrastructure management services practice, runs the infrastructure of hundreds of clients and because of this, the company has deep insights into the clients business.'
p542
aS'"We can give them feedback like \'hey, if you did this or that, you would improve things by this much\'.'
p543
aS'That\'s the opportunity I see," Sikka says.'
p544
aS"Traditionally, the IT services industry is overly focused on utilisation of employees or what per cent of their overall employees are engaged in some productive 'billable' works in a quarter."
p545
aS"Sikka wants to change this 'disproportionate' focus and use the bench for more training and education."
p546
aS"Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice-president, research, Angel Broking, says Sikka's focus is on four broad areas - delivering high operating margins to maintain Infosys' leadership in the sector; actively managing and strengthening client relationships; and put the unutilised cash on books to use by scouting for acquisitions, provided the company to be acquired meets the required return on investments criteria."
p547
aS'That would be a great way of running Infosys.'
p548
aS'But everyone agrees at the end of the day, investors and stakeholders would want Sikka to live up to his name, which literally means "coin" in Hindi.'
p549
aS'And he will be measured precisely by that - revenues - in the coming months in an organisation struggling to keep pace with the blistering growth of some of its competitors.'
p550
aS"Sikka's big claim to fame so far has been development of HANA, SAP's flagship product that allows customers to organise and process massive amount of data quickly."
p551
aS'The former chief technology officer and executive board member of SAP often referred to it as his "little girl".'
p552
aS'Infosys is eagerly waiting for another "little girl" from its new CEO.'
p553
aS'The Falta Special Economic Zone (SEZ) has allowed IT major Infosys to set up a unit in the IT SEZ proposed within Info-valley complex planned in about 500 acres of land on the outskirts of the city.'

p559
aS'For this, the company will execute a bond cum legal undertaking as prescribed under the Special Zone Rules, 2006.'

aS'The approval follows the letter of the state-run Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) to Falta SEZ requesting to issue the letter of permission (LoP) to Infosys to start operations at its Info-valley campus, the second development centre of the IT major in the city.'

aS'Idco said, the Bangalore-based company was allowed to act as a co-developer of the SEZ by the Union Commerce Ministry.'

p643
aS'The letter had some strong words for the Infosys board.'
p644
aS'Charging it with "wealth destruction", the letter said the Infosys board "had been highly conservative in the past and a continuation of such extreme conservatism at the cost of destroying shareholders wealth is not in the best interest of the company".'
p645
aS'While the founding team had demonstrated a consistent financial discipline, which resulted in investor community not pursuing this (the buyback) proposal aggressively with the board, the letter said.'

aS'"However, with the change in management resulting in all the founding members departing from the company increased the concerns of shareholders and (therefore, there is) an urgent need to consider and address this issue," it added.'

p655
aS'The company has not gone for a share buyback since its listing on the stock exchanges in 1993.'
p656
aS'Infosys had so far not articulated its strategy for use of its cash effectively, the letter said.'
p657
aS'"Given this massive net cash position and robust net income generation, Infosys is perhaps the most overcapitalised company in the Indian corporate history, from our perspective... We believe the combination of the company\'s unprecedented cash levels, robust net income growth and tremendous borrowing capacity, being a zero-debt company, provides more than enough cash for any necessary ongoing strategic investments for innovation or merger & acquisition."'
p658
aS"Besides the company's strong cash position, the letter cited other reasons, such as its traditional belief in increasing shareholder wealth and the need for enhancement of earnings per share, as reasons why the company must look at a buyback."
p659
aS'A BOLD CALL\nWhy should Infy go for share buyback?'

aS'Experts said the ongoing market rally might see MF assets getting diversified.'
p753
aS'During the start of the rally, a few stocks do see higher concentration of the AUM.'
p754
aS'But as the rally matures, incremental flows of money will go in other stocks, said Nandkumar Surti, chief executive at JPMorgan MF.'
p755
aS'This is already evident.'
p756
aS'A 30 per cent rally in the market has reduced the concentration of the top 10 stocks from 28 per cent in December 2013 to about 25 per cent in July 2014.'
p757
aS'Interestingly, all MF top picks are the market leaders in their respective sectors.'
p758
aS'Fund managers tend to be comfortable having market leaders in their portfolios, said experts.'
p759
aS"In India, the large-cap companies' universe is pretty small and this leads to concentration of large assets into few companies' stocks."
p760

p761
aS'The start-up bug seems to have bitten large Indian information technology (IT) services companies.'
p762
aS'Just a few weeks after a team from Wipro met and evaluated around 10 start-ups for a likely investment, Infosys, the countrys second largest IT services company, has also screened a handful of these.'
p763
aS'The idea was to explore an opportunity to either partner with or invest in.'
p764
aS'Speaking at an event in Mumbai on Tuesday, Infosys Chief Operating Officer U B Pravin Rao said, A couple of weeks back, we had one of the large venture capital firms showcase six-seven start-ups to us.'
p765
aS'We have started the evaluation process.'
p766
aS'The idea is to see if we can work with start-ups, help amplify their roadmap, help them in scaling up, bundle some of their products into our offerings, and wherever applicable, invest in them as well.'
p767
aS'In April last year, Infosys had announced a $100-million fund to invest in products platforms and solutions.'
p768
aS'The company has, however, not made any investments from the fund.'
p769
aS'In earlier media interactions, Infosys new chief executive, Vishal Sikka, had said he was keen on putting the fund to some use as soon as possible.'
p770
aS'While Rao did not share details about the kind of start-ups Infosys was looking at, he said the company did have some gaps in capabilities around areas such as life sciences or health care.'
p771
aS'It might look to strengthen itself in these areas.'
p772
aS'He also said they might look at strengthening its offerings or presence in certain places such as Japan or Latin America, through partnering with or acquiring of start-ups.'
p773
aS'Obviously, for us to scale organically in these areas will take time.'
p774
aS'So, we will always be continuously looking at acquisition in this space.'
p775
aS'Its not that there are too many candidates.'

aS'Bangalore: US-based Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has handed out promotions and salary hikes to its senior management team at a time when the New Jersey-based company is struggling to match its high growth rates of the past five years and starting to see some top-level exits.'
p778
aS'In an email sent out to senior employees earlier this week, Cognizant handed out what was its second round of promotions and hikes this year.'
p779
aS'The first tranche of bonuses and hikes was announced in the first week of July for employees up to managerial levels.'
p780
aS'All the hikes and promotions have been made effective from 1 July, a Cognizant spokesperson said.'
p781
aS'The average salary hike for offshore associates is around 10%.'
p782
aS'Those who are exceptional performers and have niche skills that are in high demand will get more than 10%, Cognizant said in an email.'
p783
aS'Onsite employees, who oversee software development projects at client locations, have been given single-digit hikes, Cognizant said.'
p784
aS'We do not disclose the number of promotions.'
p785
aS'We remain confident in our long-term prospects.'
p786
aS'We have promoted around a third of our programmer analysts to ensure that our people grow with the company.'
p787
aS'At higher grades, promotions are anchored around performance, potential and consistency, said Cognizant, which has most of its employees in India.'
p788
aS'Since Cognizant just about met its revenue growth target in 2013, all its top-level managers will be eligible for 85% of their total bonus payouts.'
p789
aS'In a regulatory filing earlier this year, Cognizant had said chief executive Francisco DSouza and other top employees would receive 85% of their payouts if the company met revenue targets.'
p790
aS'Cognizants average salary hikes compare favourably against those given by peers such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd.'
p791
aS'While Infosys gave hikes of about 6-7% to offsite employees and about 1-2% to onsite employees, Wipro hiked pay by 6-8% for offsite and 2-3% for onsite employees.'
p792
aS'This years salary revisions are designed to be market competitive, differentiate niche and critical talent, and reward high performance.'
p793
aS'Our salary increments are at the higher end of the industry range, Cognizant said in the email.'
p794
aS'The salary increments and promotions for senior employees come weeks after Cognizant warned of the slowest revenue growth in its 20-year history.'
p795
aS'On 6 August, Cognizant cut its guidance for the third time in the past six years and said revenue would grow by 14%, instead of the 16.5% it had forecast earlier in the year.'
p796
aS'The guidance cut surprised investors, who pulled down shares of Cognizant and those of other rivals such as Infosys and Wipro and are now paring down their expectations from the software services sector for this year.'
p797
aS'Industry lobby Nasscom has forecast software export revenues to grow by 13-15% during the 2014-15 fiscal year.'
p798
aS'Cognizant also has seen some top exits during this year, including those of former innovation head Sukumar Rajagopal and social, mobility, analytics and cloud computing head Mahesh Venkateswaran, who used to report directly to chief executive DSouza.'
p799
aS'Conventional wisdom says that if higher numbers of employees are leaving there might be something wrong at the company.'
p800
aS'This is especially true in the software sector which is completely manpower driven.'
p801
aS'Analysts measure the number of employees quitting the company on a quarterly basis in the IT sector and measure it as a percentage of total employees in the company.'
p802
aS'This, in management terminology, is called the attrition rate.'
p803
aS'Infosys has been at the receiving end of analyst recommendations on account of poor sales growth and record attrition rates.'
p804
aS'This leads to the question of whether attrition is an indicator of business momentum.'
p805
aS'A JP Morgan report answers the question in a August 27, 2014 report on Indian IT services.'
p806
aS'The study which was begun on April 8, 2013 titled We like higher industry attrition concluded that step changes in attrition (up or down) have historically led to corresponding changes in business momentum, with typically a one-quarter lead time (more than 80% correlation).'
p807
aS'What is interesting is that JP Morgan has looked at attrition at the industry level.'
p808
aS'If attrition in only one company are high, then there is a problem.'
p809
aS'But if the entire sector faces higher attrition then JP Morgan had concluded in April 2013 that it was not bad.'
p810
aS'However, in its new report, the bank says that there are recent findings that seems to negate their earlier report.'
p811
aS'According to JP Morgan attrition has been increasing significantly at the industry level in the last four quarters.'
p812
aS'Collective attrition for the top 5 IT companies hit a three-year high in the June 2014 quarter, yet industry growth has not picked up on an annual basis for the past two quarters.'
p813
aS'So what went wrong?'
p814
aS'JP Morgan says there are three reasons why growth has not picked up despite higher industry attrition.'
p815
aS'First, lack of opportunities in current roles, as companies are not growing fast enough, is inducing more departures.'
p816
aS'Thus, while the industry is adding to headcount at the net level, concerns about a companys growth and personal career advancement are leading to employees switching jobs.'
p817
aS'This leads to what is called swapping when employees (of, say, Infosys quit to join Wipro and vice versa) swap firms in the hope of finding better career advancement opportunities in their new workplace.'
p818
aS'Because of the high number of employee departures, firms such as Infosys/Wipro will find their hiring substantially backfilling roles of those departing, and not really creating new roles/positions that come with growth.'
p819
aS'Business mix plays a role in the overall attrition number.'
p820
aS'Contribution of BPO, testing and IMS (information management system) are increasing across the board.'
p821
aS'JP Morgan says that attrition in BPO and IMS segments is generally two times higher than that in IT Services.'
p822
aS'Attrition in the application segments (ERP, consulting, system integration) is generally much lower than in BPO/IMS/testing.'
p823
aS'Thus a higher contribution of BPO/IMS/testing in overall revenues may also lead to higher attrition number.'
p824
aS'Finally, captives (fully owned IT divisions of parent companies like Tesco, GE, Philips among others have become reasonably strong net hirers in the recent past (last three to four quarters).'
p825
aS'JP Morgan believes that a large number of workforces, especially from Infosys and Wipro may be leaving for captives where pay is generally better.'
p826
aS'Captives are strong draws today for employees at third-party firms, more so at a time when onsite opportunities are not as plentiful in third-party firms today as they have been in the past.'
p827
aS'JP Morgan believes that attrition cannot keep ticking up without favourable implications for demand at some point.'
p828
aS'If the September 2014 quarter too shows a higher attrition number across the industry, JP Morgan says that it is not necessarily a worrying signal.'
p829
aS'Rather it would more likely indicate an uptick in demand activity in the market.'
p830
aS'Industry-wide attrition is a good gauge of the state of ferment.'

p967
aS'The company announced a 1:1 bonus in May, 2011.'
p968
aS'The momentum slowed dramatically after a series of senior-level exits that began two years ago with the companys co-founder Rao resigning on 10 July 2012.'
p969

aS'However, in July 2013, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) issued new guidelines to telecom service providers on the procedures for activation and deactivation of VAS to protect the interest of users.'

aS'One of the first initiatives mooted by Sikka, while he was still the CEO-designate, murmuration aims at crowd-sourcing ideas from employees, which they believe could benefit the company.'
p1000
aS'These ideas could range from improvement in delivery, process improvement to skills enhancement.'
p1001

p1003
aS"Sikka had explained that the initiative is to orchestrate the company's vast employee base to win orders, return to high growth, and build new applications."
p1004
aS'While the details of the ideas that employees came up with are not known yet, sources within Infosys said the company is trying to implement all ideas that have been suggested.'
p1005
aS'The firm is also setting up a task force of senior executives to implement these ideas.'
p1006
aS'"Many of these ideas are extremely good, some are average, and some might not be implementable," said a senior source at the company.'

p1021
aS'While investors have been waiting for a sharp turnaround in Infosys performance for several quarters now, analysts are of the view that it is widely accepted that Sikka would need a few quarters before being able to show any results in the companys bottomline.'
p1022

aS'We need to give him at least two to three quarters to show some substantial results.'

aS'Until then, we need to sit tight and wait, said Manish Bahl, vice-president at independent technology and market research company Forrester Research.'

p1029
aS"Even if Infosys performance in the next two quarters is not very impressive, I don't think investors will get flustered about the company's prospects or doubt Sikka's capabilities, he added."
p1030
aS'Sikka, who comes from a non-IT services background, has already made a few early moves at Infosys, which analysts believe, were in the right direction.'
p1031
aS'Sikka announced 5,000 promotions within the first week of his joining Infosys at the beginning of this month.'
p1032
aS"Experts believe the move is likely to boost employees' morale and also help in taming the all-time-high attrition level, which is one of the primary concerns for Infosys."
p1033
aS'For the quarter ended June 30, 2014, Infosys attrition rate was at 19.5 per cent  the highest ever at the company.'
p1034
aS"Additionally, according to an update by Sikka on micro-blogging website Twitter, he spent time with several of Infosys' senior leaders in the US during an off-site over the previous few weeks."
p1035
aS'Experts are of the opinion that the activity will help the existing top-leaders of Infosys to understand and adapt to Sikkas strategy more smoothly.'
p1036
aS'Analysts have time and again said a smooth acceptance of Sikka by the existing senior leaders at Infosys is of prime importance, as this is the first time that the company has brought on board a CEO from outside.'
p1037
aS'While it was widely anticipated that Infosys might see more senior-level exits after Sikkas coming on board, none of that seems to have happened so far.'
p1038
aS'In the short term, Sikka will need to build internal confidence.'
p1039
aS'Getting a buy in from senior management, addressing investors, areas of improvement, becoming more hand on to the business are key focus areas that he will need to look at, said Sanchit Gogia, chief analyst and CEO of Greyhound Research, an independent IT and telecom research and advisory firm.'
p1040
aS'In the mid-term, Sikka will need to further partnerships and alliances particularly in emerging tech and markets.'
p1041
aS'Attrition is one aspect that requires monitoring, setting of mid managers; investing in people is going to critical in midterm.'

aS'Sikka will personally add immense wealth to alliances with product firms and to the hived off software firm.'

p1052
aS'Harish H V, partner in consultancy firm Grant Thornton, said when leaders move to a new organization, some of the other frontline people follow them because these leaders have turned their interpersonal qualities into critical leadership capability that incites action in others.'
p1053
aS'"And when a new leader comes into the organization, there is acceptance or resistance to newer ideas or styles of functioning," he said.'
p1054
aS'One source who knows Sikka said his team at SAP was an extraordinarily bright and well looked after one, and that they may not enjoy the same environment under the new dispensation.'
p1055
aS'The exits, predictably, roused speculation that they might follow Sikka to Infosys.'
p1056
aS"But it's far from clear if that would happen."
p1057
aS'Harish said even as a leader builds new bridges in a new firm, the comfort of working with older team members is a big draw.'
p1058
aS'But he cautioned that leaders "should resist poaching people from older organizations that could be governed by non-compete clauses, and likewise, not upset the apple cart in the new firm."'

aS'Mumbai: Its a little over a month since Vishal Sikka took charge as the first non-founder chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director of Indias second largest information technology (IT) services provider Infosys Ltd.'
p1064
aS'In an interview in early August, K.V.'
p1065
aS'Kamath, non-executive chairman of Infosys, said that contrary to what people might think, he has an even greater degree of responsibility, now that the baton has been passed from the founders to a professional after 33 years.'
p1066
aS'Kamath also spoke about how Infosys narrowed down on Sikka, leadership issues at the company, client perceptions and his own role going forward.'
p1067
aS'Edited excerpts:\nCan you help us understand where Infosys stands today?'
p1068
aS'Infosys actually enabled a bunch of professionals to succeed and prove that founders need not necessarily be non-technology people.'
p1069
aS'Founders can be professionals and they leverage their professional abilities to build and succeed.'
p1070
aS'So none of that has changed.'
p1071
aS'And as you did this, there is a certain culture that gets built up.'
p1072
aS'That has not changed.'
p1073
aS'And a day comes when you have to then pass the baton and move on with the next generation.'
p1074
aS'Thats what has happened.'
p1075
aS'Shibu was the last of the professional founders to leave.'
p1076
aS'And his date would have been sometime in the first quarter of next year.'
p1077
aS'So everything that has happened has to be viewed in the context of saying that he would not have minded leaving earlier if we have a plan in place.'
p1078
aS'And thats how we began working on the plan.'
p1079
aS'So if you look at the succession which has taken place, it has taken place a few months ahead of schedule.'
p1080
aS'So I think the board has worked at a pace to make sure the transition is done.'
p1081
aS'Second, the culture, systems and processes have been set in place.'
p1082
aS'And they endure.'
p1083
aS'And there are enough team members in the executive side to ensure that it can be continued with.'
p1084
aS'So this is the Infosys that Vishal Sikka inherits.'
p1085
aS'A strong cultural setup.'
p1086
aS'A strong process and systems-driven organization.'
p1087
aS'And I would say, with significant people strengths.'
p1088
aS'He has identified problems he sees and he has articulated that.'
p1089
aS'One area that he has articulated clearly is the sales side which he wants to pay attention to.'
p1090
aS'The way I would understand this is that if that is the vision of the CEO, then the board would support him in whatever way required.'
p1091
aS'To make sure that that part of the business is set right.'
p1092
aS'And we will need to see this over a period of time, how this works.'
p1093
aS'One of the things that Sikka has underscored is bringing access to boardrooms.'
p1094
aS'In that context, what are the strengths that he has in the people around him?'
p1095
aS'If I have to look at it dispassionatelyand I would like to talk about the current slateit is a young slate.'
p1096
aS'It is very high on energy.'
p1097
aS'This slate has the ability to take the ball and run with it.'
p1098
aS'So he has got a young team with the right mindset.'
p1099
aS'And I am sure he will strengthen the team as he goes along, if he feels there are areas in which the team needs to be strengthened.'
p1100
aS'Thats the job of a captain and he is a captain.'
p1101
aS'So who will those hunters be to get the business?'
p1102
aS'The sales team is clearly going to be the hunting team.'
p1103
aS'Now whether that needs further work to be done, support to be given, it is his call.'
p1104
aS'And I am sure, it has been less than a week that he has been actively in the hot seat, but knowing Vishal, I can tell you that he is probably working 24/7 at this moment.'
p1105
aS'To get a fix on what is the contribution needed going forward.'
p1106
aS'The fact about Vishal is that from conceptualizing and developing products, he went to go to market with those products.'
p1107
aS'What I think has been underplayed in all that has been written about him is his ability to go and talk to customers.'
p1108
aS'He has a network of customers.'
p1109
aS'When I look at technology play, I look at idea generation.'
p1110
aS'I want somebody across me to come from the company; he is able to tell me so many things that I have got a buffet in front of me from which I would like to choose.'
p1111
aS'I should be constrained because I dont have the energy, ability or the wherewithal.'
p1112
aS'I want that choice.'
p1113
aS'I dont want a sales agent to come to me and say I have got this product, please buy.'
p1114
aS'That is the excitement.'
p1115
aS'And that to me was the single biggest difference between him (Sikka) and those others in contention (for the Infosys CEO post).'
p1116
aS'We believe it was you who really identified him and both of you share a great equation.'
p1117
aS'How did that happen?'
p1118
aS'I know Vishal for more than three years now.'
p1119
aS'But when I happened to be invited to the SAP Labs team in India in Bangalore at their annual event to deliver the keynote, I did not know Vishal then.'
p1120
aS'And while we were driving to the event, the SAP person with me gave me a brief description of Vishal.'
p1121
aS'And you could see the excitement that this gentleman had in what Vishal was doing.'
p1122
aS'There was a lot of traffic and we had a one-hour drive, and that persons energy level was very high because Vishal was coming.'
p1123
aS'So he was telling me how hard he (Sikka) works, what thought process he brings to the table and so on.'
p1124
aS'So I said fine.'
p1125
aS'I didnt know Vishal.'
p1126
aS'We reached about 45 minutes early and Vishal was making a keynote before I reached there.'
p1127
aS'So I sat quietly in the audience listening to Vishal.'
p1128
aS'And it was a pleasure listening to him.'
p1129
aS'There were about 4,500 people.'
p1130
aS'The way he could sync with them was amazing.'
p1131
aS'It was like a maestro performing on stage.'
p1132
aS'But he was not doing a song-and-dance routine, he was doing a technology routine.'
p1133
aS'So my admiration at that point went very high.'
p1134
aS'This sort of brilliance is very rare to see.'
p1135
aS'And this sort of connect with people is also very rare to see.'
p1136
aS'I spoke about a few of my experiences in technology going back to 1997.'
p1137
aS'Somehow we connected and we kept in fairly close touch.'
p1138
aS'We would correspond.'
p1139
aS'Clearly, mutual respect.'
p1140
aS'Thereafter, completely independently, he came to Infosys.'
p1141
aS'This happened sometime last year.'
p1142
aS'I think Shibu (S.D.'
p1143
aS'Shibulal) arranged for him to come and then he was invited to come to our (Infosys) annual strategy meeting, Strap (Strategic and Action Planning).'
p1144
aS'But he couldnt make it; so he did a video conference.'
p1145
aS'In early 2014, Vishal called to say he was leaving SAP.'
p1146
aS'And then it worked out exactly as he had said.'
p1147
aS'Without getting too much into the past, but looking at it from a leadership point of view, you had some real good people internally.'
p1148
aS'And then, there was this choice of Sikka.'
p1149
aS'From the boards point of view, how did you look at this internal versus external debate?'
p1150
aS'We in a way dealt with the hand we had.'
p1151
aS'It was around the time of our annual results (February-March 2014 period).'
p1152
aS'If there was a successor in place, Shibu (said he) wont mind leaving earlier than planned.'
p1153
aS'So we started the work (of looking out for a new CEO).'
p1154
aS'The board was very open and we said on Day 1 that we will look at both internal and external candidates.'
p1155
aS'We went through the dual process of looking at an external evaluation and an internal evaluation using two sets of people who have worked with in terms of the process.'
p1156
aS'One which worked predominantly on internal candidates, and one which did work on the external slate.'
p1157
aS'Based on that we took a call, at that point in time.'
p1158
aS'Did it affect the decision in any way that FIIs (foreign institutional investors) at that time had a little over 40% stake in the company?'
p1159
aS'Absolutely not.'
p1160
aS'See, the board has the fiduciary responsibility to all shareholders.'
p1161
aS'So basically it shows the person that it serves the best interest of the company.'
p1162
aS'As non-executive chairman, how does your role change now?'
p1163
aS'I dont interfere in day-to-day matters.'
p1164
aS'Im available for counselling and advice, but the ultimate decision has to be made by the CEO.'
p1165
aS'In the committees, and the board processes, you are the key person and you will take the call.'
p1166
aS'You will decide.'
p1167
aS'Because that is the duty of the board and you will perform that duty.'
p1168
aS'This is what I did for two years as chairman and (that is) exactly what I will do going forward with Vishal.'
p1169
aS'A part of the responsibility is also to pull up the CEO when something is not working out?'
p1170
aS'It is.'
p1171
aS'But pulling up is also (done) through the board process.'
p1172
aS'I will not call the CEO and tell him I have a problem.'
p1173
aS'You do it at the appropriate time during a board meeting.'
p1174
aS'The process doesnt generally come about.'
p1175
aS'When you look at the board process, sometimes people who observe believe that you need to take action tomorrow.'
p1176
aS'You cannot unless there is something so dire that you need to.'
p1177
aS'Particularly in terms of performance.'
p1178
aS'You have to understand the root cause of performance.'
p1179
aS'You have to then see whether solutions are available.'
p1180
aS'And then you need to see whether you can come to a common agreement on them.'
p1181
aS'Particularly if you have people who have knowledge in the business, then you have to be even more careful.'
p1182
aS'Like you are not taking a decision too early and so on.'
p1183
aS'All of this come into play; so it is never that you will call up and say this is wrong.'
p1184
aS'That is not your job.'
p1185
aS'Your job is to observe, understand, analyse, connect and then get a consensus on the decision.'
p1186
aS'What, to your mind, is the perception of the company especially in the light of what happened in the last few years?'
p1187
aS'Whatever the perception, I think it stems from the single key point that Vishal has made.'
p1188
aS'That is, not getting sales growth to where it was when Infosys was a bellwether.'
p1189
aS'He has identified I think his challenge upfront on Day 1.'
p1190
aS'Having done that, I am sure he will work on it.'
p1191
aS'And thats how we need to keep track of it.'
p1192
aS'And help him with anything that he needs help with.'
p1193
aS'Once you have identified it as your key, thereafter you will work to a solution.'
p1194
aS'The word glory (context: Infosys says its wants to regain its past glory) is that something that can be chased?'
p1195
aS'See, the word glory is not something that I would chase.'
p1196
aS'I would look at several different ways to describe what you need to do.'
p1197
aS'They include, how do you meet challenges, how do you seek opportunities, how do you execute on the changing marketplace, changing the IT contextthere are so many ways in which you can describe your agenda.'
p1198
aS'And I am very happy that Vishal has put it that the companys agenda is very simply getting the sales engine to where it ought to be.'
p1199
aS'The moment you do that, all other things fall in place.'
p1200
aS'If you look at the last one year and I think which Murthy has articulated that well also.'
p1201
aS'There are two challengessales line and the cost line.'
p1202
aS'I think he has clearly articulated how the cost line has been brought into control.'
p1203
aS'And the new CEO has very clearly articulated in a succinct way what is the challenge remaining.'
p1204
aS'So he can very clearly understand what is required to be done in terms of attention going forward.'
p1205
aS'Does the style of leadership change when you have a founder at the helm compared to a professional?'
p1206
aS'And how do you deal with it at the board?'
p1207
aS'No, there is no change.'
p1208
aS'What I think a board member has to be conscious of at all times is how is the experience of the person you are talking to, in a particular context.'
p1209
aS'And read into that.'
p1210
aS'So if business is not doing well but you have somebody with years of experience in that business, you would still like to see what he thinks before you try and impose your view of how it will work.'
p1211
aS'If somebody doesnt have experience, maybe you will have to jointly explore (to find a solution).'
p1212
aS'The process has nothing to do with, whether the person is a founder or not.'
p1213
aS'On the board, your duty and care is to the company which is an entity by itself.'
p1214
aS'My job was very simply to put a succession in place.'
p1215
aS'Bangalore/Mumbai: On 25 April 2013, directors on the board of Infosys Ltd received an email from Baburaj Pillai, chief investment officer of Singapore-based Arohi Asset Management Pte.'
p1216
aS'Ltd, who described himself as a long time shareholder and well-wisher of Infosys.'
p1217
aS'The tone of his email was polite but the message was toughbring back (founder) N.R.'
p1218
aS'Narayana Murthy in an executive role, or else....'
p1219
aS'I feel very strongly that if any other shareholder were to initiate a resolution nominating Mr Murthy, it would receive an overwhelmingly favourable vote.'
p1220
aS'This however would not cast the board in good light, which I feel will hurt Infosys.'
p1221
aS'And then, for good measure, he warned that if the board collectively decides that status quo is the best decision, then, at the very least, the board is prepared for any potential shareholder activism.'
p1222
aS'Pillai, also the founder of Arohi, attached another detailed letter to his email, elaborating his case, starting with a plea to bring Mr Murthy back and stressing his own long association with the company, first as a portfolio manager for Government of Singapore Investment Corp., and then, on behalf of his clients at Arohi.'
p1223
aS'Mint has a copy of the email and the attachment.'
p1224
aS'Within hours of receiving the email, K.V.'
p1225
aS'Kamath, chairman of the Infosys board, reached out to all board members to seek their advice.'
p1226
aS'One former board member remembers the call.'
p1227
aS'This is the best thing for the company.'
p1228
aS'We should do it.'
p1229
aS'There is no other choice, he says he told Kamath.'
p1230
aS'Kamath said in an interview that he doesnt remember having this conversation.'
p1231
aS'But theres a backstory to the email, according to this person; like many others who spoke to Mint for this article, he wished to remain unidentified.'
p1232
aS'The email and the backstory were clearly incendiary enough for Infosys, once one of Indias most media-savvy companies, to issue legal notices to three publications owned by Bennett, Coleman and Co. Ltd and The Indian Express Ltd for Rs.2,000 crore each.'
p1233
aS'The legal notices claimed that articles published by these newspapers had defamed the company, but people familiar with the matter said these were shots across the bows of their newsrooms, to prevent them from publishing the backstory.'
p1234
aS'Infosys also exhibited the kind of nervousness not usually associated with the company about the Mint story.'
p1235
aS'A senior executive at its newly appointed public relations (PR) agency, Mumbai-based Adfactors, known for its fire-fighting skills and expertise in ensuring initial public offerings (IPOs) get the right kind of publicity, reached out to Mint twice, once presumably to stall the story, and a second time to express concern over the direction the story seemed to be taking (questions were mailed to Murthy who, through Adfactors, declined to participate in the story).'
p1236
aS'Heres the backstory that Mint pieced together from interviews with board members and others who have knowledge of the matter.'
p1237
aS'Murthys comeback\nThe former board member cited above met Murthy in the middle of April 2013, at the latters house in Jayanagar, Bangalore, where he declared his intention to leave the company.'
p1238
aS'Shibulal is running the company to the ground, he told Murthy.'
p1239
aS'S.D.'
p1240
aS'Shibulal was the chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director of Infosys then, one of the companys co-founders, and an early protege of Murthy.'
p1241
aS'On 13 April, after its earnings announcement, the Infosys scrip had fallen by 21%, its worst decline in a decade.'
p1242
aS'This event had spooked several insiders, including the board member cited above (Board Member #1).'
p1243
aS'The company is not going anywhere, continued Board Member #1.'
p1244
aS'You should come back.'
p1245
aS'We need a good anchor to energize the company.'
p1246
aS'Bring the growth back.'
p1247
aS'The leadership is loyal to you and they will align to what you say.'
p1248
aS'Murthy was reluctant.'
p1249
aS'This wasnt the first time the board member had tried to get Murthy to come back.'
p1250
aS'A month earlier he tried the same argument, but through a different approachusing the offices of Pillai, who was visiting Bangalore at the time.'
p1251
aS'Pillai met with Murthy, who refused to even consider coming back to Infosys.'
p1252
aS'Pillai did not respond to a detailed email questionnaire.'
p1253
aS'Now, Board Member #1 was trying again, this time directly, and leveraging the threat of quitting the company.'
p1254
aS'Shareholders are unhappy, the board is dysfunctional, not able to take any decision, employees are unhappy.'
p1255
aS'You should come in to create some breathing space, he told Murthy.'
p1256
aS'This time though, Murthy was amenable to the suggestion.'
p1257
aS'A few days later, Board Member #1 got a message from Murthy that he would consider coming back if there was external pressure.'
p1258
aS'Immediately, Board Member #1 called Pillai.'
p1259
aS'Kamath said that any theory about any board member orchestrating Murthys return is absolutely false.'
p1260
aS'Indeed, it is possible that Pillai acted on his own accord, and that the board decided to ask Murthy to return to an executive position because that was the best option before it.'
p1261
aS'Whatever be the case, by the end of the month, the board of Infosys asked and convinced Murthy to return.'
p1262
aS'His return, as has been widely reported, broke two rules Infosyss co-founders had set for themselves: that they would retire at 60 (Murthy was coming back to an executive position at the age of 67); and that none of their family would be employed at the company (Murthy wanted his son Rohan to be his executive assistant).'
p1263
aS'Once he had decided to come back, Murthy, Board Member #1 says, reached out to his former A-team.'
p1264
aS'Responding to a call from Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, who was then running the governments Unique Identification Authority of India, said he had moved on.'
p1265
aS'Nilekani did not respond to an email seeking comment.'
p1266
aS'Murthy then reached out to T.V.'
p1267
aS'Mohandas Pai, former chief financial officer and director of human resources at Infosys.'
p1268
aS'He too declined.'
p1269
aS'On 1 June 2013, nearly a month and a half after the events detailed above were set in motion, Murthy announced his comeback.'
p1270
aS'In a statement issued by the company, Murthy said: This calling was sudden, unexpected, and most unusual.'
p1271
aS'But, then, Infosys is my middle child.'
p1272
aS'Therefore, I have put aside my plans-in-progress and accepted this responsibility.'
p1273
aS'Only, it wasnt really sudden or unexpected, and doesnt really show Infosyss board in the best light.'
p1274
aS'A failure of the board\nHow did an $8 billion company, a former bellwether of the information technology (IT) industry, get here?'
p1275
aS'Why did it turn as desperate as to seek the return from retirement of its first CEO?'
p1276
aS'One of the most important responsibilities of any board is planning for successionidentifying at least one leader who can immediately take up the role if the current CEO gets hit by a bus.'
p1277
aS'What happened at Infosys?'
p1278
aS'They have known for nine years that Kris and Shibu are the last in the line (among founders preordained to head the company), says a former board member of Infosys (or Board Member #2).'
p1279
aS'Kris is S. Gopalakrishnan, Shibulals predecessor as CEO.'
p1280
aS'If things were not working out under Shibu, then the next CEO should have been appointed then and there, says another former board member (Board Member #3).'
p1281
aS'But it clearly didnt happen, and more on that later.'
p1282
aS'A current board member, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak with the press, says that the directors were caught in a situation where there were just too many moving parts.'
p1283
aS'While the board was preparing for succession planning, keeping in mind Shibulals date of retirement (early 2015), two things changed in quick successiongrowth petered out and the company got ensnared in a messy legal battle about visas in the US.'
p1284
aS'That was in July 2012; by then, Shibulal had been in charge for less than 12 months.'
p1285
aS'You did not have too many quarters to take the decision on what is the corrective, says the board member.'
p1286
aS'And then Infosys faced this other challenge, probably the biggest challenge, of the US visa.'
p1287
aS'I have not seen anybody question and go into the root of it; when did that happen, it did not happen under Shibu.'
p1288
aS'It happened under somebody else and somebody else is responsible for this activity.'
p1289
aS'So all governance issues have come on Shibus shoulders; 40% of his energy was on that.'
p1290
aS'We as a board were trying to cope with all this.'
p1291
aS'That is, till things became too hot to handle.'
p1292
aS'And Murthy came in.'
p1293
aS'Botching up succession planning was not the only lapse of the board.'
p1294
aS'The appointment of Rohan Murty as his fathers executive assistant (EA) was another low.'
p1295
aS'Way back in 1994, Infosys started a programme called Voice of Youth.'
p1296
aS'The idea was to harness the creative energy of its young employees and also develop future leaders.'
p1297
aS'Then there is the Infosys Leadership Institute in Mysorean institute that was supposed to churn out 500 leaders at one point in time.'
p1298
aS'What stopped Murthy from picking an EA from within?'
p1299
aS'asks Board Member #3.'
p1300
aS'What happened to these hallowed institutions?'
p1301
aS'They couldnt produce one EA.'
p1302
aS'All about compliance?'
p1303
aS'The (current) board member says that Infosys did not cross the line on any governance issue.'
p1304
aS'According to him, governance implies disclosure.'
p1305
aS'As long as you disclose, there is no governance issue, he says.'
p1306
aS'And I dont think Rohan enjoyed any more authority than an EA should.'
p1307
aS'Most people that Mint spoke to whove served on the board of Infosys in the past agree on one thing though.'
p1308
aS'When Narayana Murthy says something, everybody agrees.'
p1309
aS'It was always about compliance, you know, says Board Member #3.'
p1310
aS'Compliance for regulators, compliance for financials, and it is one of the best paying boards in the country.'
p1311
aS'A director makes about Rs.80 lakh.'
p1312
aS'Despite all of this, it was always about compliance, never about commitment.'
p1313
aS'In early 2014, about six months after Murthy came back at Infosys, the nominations committee of the company was changed.'
p1314
aS'Jeffrey S. Lehman, Ravi Venkatesan and Ann M. Fudge were replaced by Kamath, R. Seshasayee and Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson of Biocon Ltd. No reasons were given for the sudden change.'
p1315
aS'According to Board Member #2, Fudge, among others, was alarmed by the changes at Infosys.'
p1316
aS'She eventually decided not to seek re-election after completing her three-year term.'
p1317
aS'Fudge did not reply to a detailed email questionnaire seeking comment.'
p1318
aS'Lehman said there was nothing unusual or untoward about the appointment of a new committee .'
p1319
aS'Lehman, who has been on the board of Infosys since April 2006, also said he intends to remain on the board until he reaches the term limit imposed by Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) rules.'
p1320
aS'Board Member #3 believes Kamath, former head of ICICI Bank Ltd, should have done better.'
p1321
aS'He was ruthless at ICICI, says the board member.'
p1322
aS'Why did he go blunt?'
p1323
aS'Is it because, as a former Infosys employee who worked closely with Kamath says, he felt he was an outsider?'
p1324
aS'Kamath denies this.'
p1325
aS'Never, he says.'
p1326
aS'I was very conscious of the fact that you had people who know this business for the last 30 years.'
p1327
aS'And you have to respect that.'
p1328
aS'Still, it remains that Kamath never really critiqued Shibulals performance as CEO.'
p1329
aS'Maybe because to have done that would have been tantamount to questioning Murthys philosophy of management at Infosysthat every founder would have a go at the wheel.'
p1330
aS'The Shibulal story\nS.D.'
p1331
aS'Shibulal, the last of the founder-CEOs of Infosys.'
p1332
aS'Photo: Bloomberg\nSarojini Damodaran Shibulal, now 59, will possibly go down in corporate history as one of the most vilified CEOs in the history of Indian IT.'
p1333
aS'On Glassdoor, an employee-rating website, his approval rating stood at 50-60% in May 2014the lowest among CEOs.'
p1334
aS'One of the seven founders who attained rock-star status after Infosys rose through the 1990s and 2000s to become Indias most admired company, Shibulal appeared clueless as Infosys lost its exalted bellwether status, underwent the worst financial performance in its history, surrendered its premium pricing position and was comparedunfavourablywith rivals it once used to ridicule.'
p1335
aS'Such was the state of affairs under Shibu, as he is popularly known, that within a year of his tenure as CEO, Infosys started missing its own annual revenue guidance.'
p1336
aS'Soon after, investors and analysts started speculating on when Infosys would start looking for a replacement for Shibulal.'
p1337
aS'No other Infosys founder had to undergo such ignominy.'
p1338
aS'Current board members also started to feel the heat.'
p1339
aS'In October 2013, all the independent directors on the board of Infosys received an email from an angry US-based shareholderone of several mails the board received from worried shareholders over the course of the last 18 months.'
p1340
aS'In the letter, the shareholder questioned the boards decision to retain Shibulal as CEO even after Murthy came back and why Shibulal and even vice-chairman Gopalakrishnan were not held accountable for Infosyss poor performance between 2011 and 2013.'
p1341
aS'One board member thought the shareholders questions had merit.'
p1342
aS'In a letter to Kamath and other independent directors, independent director Omkar Goswami said the board should not ignore the email.'
p1343
aS'Clearly (the shareholder) has marshalled fairly sound data.'
p1344
aS'I believe an appropriately correct and possibly assuaging response may be warranted.'
p1345
aS'I leave it to you, my other colleagues and General Counsel to choose the correct path.'
p1346
aS'But we shouldnt ignore it, Goswami wrote in the email.'
p1347
aS'Mint has seen both letters.'
p1348
aS'During his term, Shibulal, the only founder to have taken a break from Infosys to work at a different company (Sun Microsystems Inc.), doggedly pursued a widely criticized business strategythe so-called Infosys 3.0that snowballed into disaster.'
p1349
aS'This strategy, touted as a bold bet when it was announced, was the companys attempt to separate itself from the rat pack by venturing aggressively into newer areas of technology such as cloud computing, software application products and platforms.'
p1350
aS'Infosys fell into the classic Founder Trap and thats what has put it in its current predicament, said the CEO of one of Indias top five IT firms, which competes with Infosys.'
p1351
aS'He requested anonymity.'
p1352
aS'It shouldve got an outsider or a non-founder as CEO at least five years ago.'
p1353
aS'Timing, execution\nThe 3.0 strategy was akin to changing the engines of a plane mid-flight.'
p1354
aS'The problem was its timing.'
p1355
aS'Oh, and the execution, too.'
p1356
aS'Which eventually led to Infosys dropping the ball with its traditional outsourcing business, as Murthy made it clear on his comeback at Infosys.'
p1357
aS'To add to that, Shibulal promoted leaders whom he favoured and sidelined others who were overseeing important portfolios and were seen as threats to his position, according to several Infosys executives, who requested anonymity.'
p1358
aS'Several Infosys insiders point to an instance when Shibulal, sometime in 2012, swapped the portfolios of banking and financial services, and manufacturing that Ashok Vemuri and B.G.'
p1359
aS'Srinivasboth were seen at the time as potential future CEOswere overseeing, respectively.'
p1360
aS'That decision defied logic, says an Infosys executive.'
p1361
aS'To be fair, Shibulals tenure also coincided with the post-recession period when top Fortune 500 clients had tightened their IT budgets.'
p1362
aS'And for an industry where traditional plain-vanilla software and desktop maintenance projects were getting increasingly commoditized and automated, and customers were increasingly demanding more for less.'
p1363
aS'The 3.0 strategy indicated a willingness on Infosyss part to undertake bold transformations in a rapidly evolving technology landscape.'
p1364
aS'But customers had not drastically reduced outsourcing traditional software development projects.'
p1365
aS'Nor were they interested (just not yet) in making bold new, expensive bets.'
p1366
aS'It is here that Infosys lost out to competitors such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and US-based Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.\nShibulal though vehemently defended his tenure during recent press briefings.'
p1367
aS'Infosys today is much stronger than it was when I took over, he said in an April interview with Mint.'
p1368
aS'Publicly Kamath, non-executive chairman of Infosys between 2011 and 2013, continued to back Shibulal through all these decisions.'
p1369
aS'In private, it was a different story altogether.'

aS'The exodus\nIn June 2014, Vishal Sikka was appointed as the first non-founder CEO of Infosys.'
p1372
aS'Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint\nCelebrations around Murthys comeback lasted just about a month.'
p1373
aS'Then global sales head Basab Pradhan was asked to go.'
p1374
aS'At the time, Murthy spoke about the need to take tough decisions to return the company to its former health.'
p1375
aS'No eyebrows were raised.'
p1376
aS'It was assumed that Pradhans exit was part of an early shake-up that Murthy was orchestrating.'
p1377
aS'Next to go was Sudhir Chaturvedi, a man who oversaw some of Infosyss most important financial services accounts and was responsible for over a billion dollars worth of business.'
p1378
aS'The trickle became a stream.'
p1379
aS'Even when Vemuri quit in August 2013 to join iGate Corp., nobody was ready to press the panic button yet.'
p1380
aS'Vemuri had a simple choice before him.'
p1381
aS'A three-in-one chance to become the CEO of Infosys.'
p1382
aS'Or the top job at iGate.'
p1383
aS'He chose the latter.'
p1384
aS'This happened after nearly half-a-dozen more exits, capped by V. Balakrishnans departure in December that effectively left only Srinivas as a viable internal candidate for the post of CEO.'
p1385
aS'Balakrishnans departure was anything but pleasant.'
p1386
aS'According to a person familiar with the development, from the time Murthy came in, the two had been discussing the idea of three co-chief operating officers (COOs): Vemuri, Srinivas and Balakrishnan himself.'
p1387
aS'While Murthy seemed agreeable to the idea, he wasnt acting on it.'
p1388
aS'On 20 December 2013, after a make-or-break discussion that told him that he was not getting his way, Balakrishnan quit.'
p1389
aS'It was also his last day at Infosys.'
p1390
aS'Meanwhile, Murthy was continuing to ask people to go.'
p1391
aS'You see, Murthy left the executive position at Infosys in 2001-02, says Board Member #1.'
p1392
aS'When he came back, his mindset was: Why do all these sales guys get paid so much?'
p1393
aS'Let us replace them with freshers.'
p1394
aS'Murthy for one continued to believe that most people who had left were not adding value to the company.'
p1395
aS'Even as all this was happening, the board seriously started considering the possibility of an outsider CEO.'
p1396
aS'In early 2014, Kamath suggested Vishal Sikkas name.'
p1397
aS'It was then that Srinivas approached Murthy and asked him about his chances of becoming CEO, according to Board Member #4.'
p1398
aS'He was told he would not become CEO and there were others who were ahead in the race; he quit.'
p1399
aS'That was on 28 May 2014.'
p1400
aS'Srinivas didnt respond to an email seeking comment.'
p1401
aS'Srinivass departure was the 11th top-level exit from Infosys from the time Murthy took over.'
p1402
aS'And with him went an entire generation of leaders, most of whom had ironically been hand-picked by Murthy and the other founders themselves.'
p1403
aS'In June, with the appointment of Sikka, the first non-founder CEO at Infosys, Murthy and his son moved out of the company.'
p1404
aS'Murthys legacy\nIn the midst of the hoopla surrounding Sikkas appointment as CEO, no one really asked why Murthy, who had suggested that he would stay for five years when he returned in 2013, left barely 12 months later.'
p1405
aS'There are two explanations.'
p1406
aS'One, Murthys presence may have been a deterrent to potential CEOs who did not want to operate under the shadow of an active chairman.'
p1407
aS'So, Murthy had to goat least from his executive role.'
p1408
aS'Once Murthy decided to leave, the other founders followed suit.'
p1409
aS'Two, having zeroed in on a successor, Murthy felt the time was ripe to cut his losses and move out.'
p1410
aS'He couldnt work the magic and did not want this to be widely known.'
p1411
aS'So he decided to cut his losses.'
p1412
aS'He is a man famous for his oft-repeated line: under-promise and over-deliver.'
p1413
aS'This situation was the opposite.'
p1414
aS'He wanted to go out in a blaze of glory.'
p1415
aS'Like Steve Jobs.'
p1416
aS'Instead, things had spun out of control and trust (in him) plummeted, said Board Member #3.'
p1417
aS'There is yet another theory, a contrarian one, and this suggests Murthy did just what was expected of him.'
p1418
aS'A third current board member of Infosys conceded that while Murthy could not solve Infosyss growth problem, he successfully cleaned up the deadwood that was dragging Infosys down.'
p1419
aS'What he did was clean up the ship.'
p1420
aS'One can easily argue that the current set of leaders who replaced the lot that left are easily a brighter set.'
p1421
aS'Hes cleared the decks for Vishal.'
p1422
aS'The second current board member echoed similar sentiments and said Murthy was instrumental in solving Infyosyss succession-planning dilemma.'
p1423
aS'Murthy had the challenge of putting a proper succession plan in place, which he executed.'
p1424
aS'And that was most important, given that the issue of succession planning wasnt exactly addressed under Kris and Shibu, added this person.'
p1425
aS'In the 2000s, as a procession of founders had their go at the top job at Infosys, the chairman of the companys rival across town told a reporter that while Infosys had democratized ownership (by going public; he continued to hold most of his companys shares at the time), he had democratized management.'
p1426
aS'With Sikkas entry, Infosys can finally claim to have democratized management, too.'
p1427
aS'Wipro, the Bangalore-based information technology major, is trying to boost internal innovation.'
p1428
aS'The countrys third largest IT services company has identified focus areas for initiatives in this regard and has also allocated budgets for these.'

aS'Among others, it is investing in innovation in cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, man-machine interface, robotics, smart devices and open source.'
p1430
aS'The company believes these could become revenue-accretive in two to five years.'
p1431
aS'Historically, companies have focused on run the business and change the business.'
p1432
aS'With the disruption  around us today, innovation has become of key importance.'
p1433
aS'That is the reason why at Wipro, innovation is now directly under the chief executives radar, K R Sanjiv, chief technology officer (CTO), told Business Standard.'
p1434
aS'IF IN DOUBT, INNOVATE\nWipro is investing in innovation in cognitive technologies, artificial intelligence, man-machine interface, robotics, smart devices and open source\n\r\nThe company believes these could become revenue-accretive in two to five years\n\r\nThe company says it wishes to ensure no silos or divides\n\r\nThe initial corpus of $100 million will be invested in opportunities in start-up companies focused on niche technologies\n\r\nAdding: Typically, the investment budgets for companies used to be 60 per cent for running the business and 40 per cent for the changes that are visible in the marketplace today.'
p1435
aS'Now, we are also seeing a direct budget allocation for innovation.'
p1436
aS'This is happening at Wipro as well.'
p1437
aS'While run the business refers to the core bread-and-butter IT services work, change the business means new technologies like analytics and big data.'

p1658
aS'In rupee terms the company posted a 4.5% growth at Rs 13,342 crore.'
p1659
aS'2)    On the operations front, there seems to be an improvement with administrative cost coming down by 9.9% from the previous year, but this is mainly on account of Rs 219 crore provisioning due to visa related matter in the previous year.'
p1660
aS'What is noteworthy is that Infosyss cost of sales has grown at a slower pace than its revenue on sequential basis and has actually come down on an annual basis.'

aS'Cost of sales fell by 2.2% as compared to previous year but increased by only 1.9% sequentially, compared to a revenue growth of 4.5% in rupee terms.'
p1662
aS'This is on account of lower employee benefit cost which fell to Rs 7,522 crore in September 2014 quarter as compared to Rs 7,704 crore in the same quarter last year, the only positive of high attritions over the last few quarters.'

aS'Utilisation rates including trainees have also increased from 74.8% in the previous quarter to 75.2% in September 2014.'
p1670
aS'This number stood at 73.1% in September 2013.'

aS'Rao, who claims his leadership style is "optimistic" (not \'cautiously optimistic\'), said in the recent past, the company had considered a couple of large acquisition targets but did not proceed due to certain mismatches in terms of the overall strategy and valuation.'
p2012
aS'Unlike some of its other Indian or offshore-centric information technology (IT) services peers, Infosys is not perceived as aggressive in pursuing mergers & acquisitions (M&As).'
p2013
aS'Since its inception, it has carried out only five acquisitions, the largest being Lodestone, a Switzerland-based management consultancy firm Infosys had acquired in September 2012 for about $345 million (Rs 1,930 crore).'
p2014
aS'Two of the acquisitions - McCamish ($58 million) and Portland Group (A$34 million) - were in business process outsourcing.'
p2015
aS'In 2008, Infosys had offered to buy UK-based SAP consulting company Axon Group for about Rs 3,300 crore ($753.1 million), though it backed out after peer HCL Technologies bid a higher price.'
p2016
aS'It was learnt Infosys had also shown interest in acquiring TriZetto, a US-based health care IT solutions firm that was eventually acquired by Cognizant for a whopping $2.7 billion.'
p2017
aS'"We take risks but finally, we can\'t be foolhardy.'
p2018
aS'If you look at Axon, it made better sense for HCL than us at that stage.'
p2019
aS'We wanted it but there was a limit on how much we wanted to pay.'
p2020
aS'So beyond that, it did not make any sense for us.'
p2021
aS'It was because we already had a dominant SAP practice; we still have the dominance today," Rao said.'
p2022
aS'He added Infosys was eyeing large acquisitions in areas such as health care and the government business space in the US, where it already had a subsidiary, Infosys Public Services.'
p2023
aS'In terms of locations, the company is looking at the Nordic countries and Japan.'
p2024
aS'Rao said the company was also looking at smaller acquisitions to acquire capabilities in new technologies such as automation, analytics and big data.'
p2025
aS'"Probably, these will be smaller (acquisitions) because I don\'t think there are many large companies in these spaces."'
p2026
aS'In terms of M&As, Rao said Infosys could have done more captive acquisitions, akin to its peer Tata Consultancy Services, adding failure on this front was why the company had lost out in rapidly growing its core business.'
p2027
aS'"That (captive acquisition) is an area where we have publicly stated we missed the boat."'
p2028
aS'Rao said the new strategy unveiled by chief executive Vishal Sikka earlier this month had gone down well with clients, as well as employees.'
p2029
aS'He said while from one perspective, the new strategy remains was almost the same as Infosys 3.0, the company was focusing more on execution.'
p2030
aS'"We are quite clear there will be equal focus on the core business (application, development and maintenance, which the company often dubs the \'bread and butter\' business), as well as new areas such as design-thinking, platform-centric services and automation."'
p2031
aS"He added while the company's attrition rate continued to be high, there was a drop in attrition numbers every month."
p2032
aS"Under the new management, Infosys had launched the 'murmuration' initiative to crowd-source innovative ideas from employees."
p2033
aS'Rao said the company had received an overwhelming response to this, adding some of the ideas selected had been put to vote.'
p2034
aS'On the business environment, the chief operating officer said he believed some of the company\'s "struggles" were past, adding he was now more "optimistic" about Infosys\'s growth prospects.'
p2035
aS"BANGALORE: Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka has on a couple of occasions in recent weeks dismissed Trizetto, the US healthcare solutions company that Cognizant acquired last month for $2.7 billion, as yesterday's technology."
p2036
aS'But multiple sources told TOI that Infosys was among the aggressive bidders for the company, though clearly not as aggressive as Cognizant.'
p2037
aS"Infosys' senior management is said to have spent considerable time pursuing a deal with Trizetto, but pricing became the eventual barrier."
p2038
aS'When TOI asked Infosys about it, the company said, "We won\'t be commenting on your query."'
p2039
aS'TOI has also learnt that other IT services providers including TCS, Accenture and Wipro also looked at the deal.'
p2040
aS"For analysts, Infosys' Trizetto bid signals a shift in its M&A; strategy."
p2041
aS'"It demonstrates an appetite for large acquisitions in newer areas like healthcare that\'s becoming the \'new financial services\' for IT/BPO companies," said an analyst, who did not want to be named.'
p2042
aS'The US Affordable Care Act, which makes it necessary for payers (insurance companies) and providers (hospitals) to reduce cost and deliver quality services, is a huge opportunity for IT services companies.'
p2043
aS"Healthcare contributes about 2% to Infosys' revenues."
p2044
aS'Trizetto has over $700 million in revenues.'
p2045
aS'Cognizant and Trizetto combined will have more than $3 billion in healthcare revenue, and serve nearly 245,000 healthcare providers, as well as about 350 payers with approximately 180 million covered lives in the US.'
p2046
aS'Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, described the acquisition as the most significant and sizable yet by an Indian IT service provider.'
p2047
aS'"It paves the way for how we expect future services growth to take shape.'
p2048
aS'In short, Cognizant wants to provide complete BPaaS (business process as a service) for healthcare clients and recently won HealthNet in a major IT and BPO deal.'
p2049
aS'Now the firm owns technology that\'s proven and can look to challenge the likes of Accenture at the forefront of the healthcare IT/BPO services industry," he said.'
p2050
aS'However, Sikka, when asked about the acquisition recently had said, "We wish them (Cognizant) the best on that.'
p2051
aS'We at Infosys look at acquisitions that bring us unique skills, capabilities and technologies that help us to go into the areas that we find strategic for our future.'
p2052
aS'We are not interested in acquiring a previous generation company no matter how big or small.'
p2053
aS'We would rather focus on the future."'
p2054
aS"Analysts, however, think pricing could have been a barrier for Infosys, even though it's sitting on a cash pile of $5.4 billion."
p2055
aS'"It\'s quite possible Infosys did not want to pay the price that was required to win.'
p2056
aS'I have no doubt that at a lower price they would have wanted it," said Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO of IT research and advisory firm Everest Group.'
p2057
aS'Trizetto is also an Infosys and Wipro partner; the latter two use Trizetto solutions to service their healthcare clients.'
p2058
aS'Bendor-Samuel said Infosys has a significant exposure to Trizetto, much more than Wipro.'
p2059
aS'"My sense is it is around 10-15% of their payer-provider revenues," he said.'
p2060
aS'That would have been another reason why Infosys would have wanted Trizetto.'
p2061
aS"A group of women employees at Infosys, India's second largest information technology (IT) services company, has brought charges of sexual harassment against a senior executive of the company."
p2062
aS'In a mail sent from an unidentified email ID, they said the board of directors was "hushing up the whole case", though the charges are serious.'
p2063
aS'Commenting on the charges, an Infosys spokesperson said: "We take every sexual harassment complaint very seriously and each case is thoroughly and expeditiously investigated.'
p2064
aS'Swift and appropriate actions are taken in all such cases.'
p2065
aS'Keeping in view the privacy aspects we do not share particulars of individual cases."'
p2066
aS'The spokesperson said the company prided itself on the diversity of its workforce and an equal opportunity work environment for its employees.'
p2067
aS"It is reliably learnt that the company constituted a team of external investigators, who after due investigation came to the conclusion that it was a matter of 'gender insensitivity'."
p2068
aS'"Appropriate action has been taken against the said individual," a source added.'
p2069
aS'In 2002, Infosys had dismissed Phaneesh Murthy, who was then heading global sales for the company, on charges of sexual harassment.'
p2070
aS'Murthy, who later become the chief executive officer of mid-sized IT services player IGate was sacked from the job due to a relationship with a subordinate employee and on sexual harassment charges.'
p2071
aS'"We are a group of women employees working in the secretarial and compliance team at Infosys.'
p2072
aS'We had filed a sexual harassment complaint against (name withheld).'
p2073
aS'Even though, the charges were serious, the board had not taken action and is hushing up the whole case," the mail sent to this newspaper, said.'
p2074
aS'"We request you to take up this issue and get us justice," the mail undersigned as \'Infy women employees\' added.'
p2075
aS"The email was sent from an email ID 'infywomen@outlook.com.'"
p2076
aS'Since the charges are not proven, Business Standard will not disclose the identity of the senior executive against whom the charges have been levelled.'
p2077
aS'The executive also could not be contacted for his comments.'
p2078
aS'Sometime last quarter, a large mining company approached Infosys with a unique problem.'
p2079
aS'The company, which operates thousands of expensive trucks to carry minerals, wanted a predictive maintenance platform to avoid the loss it incurred when those vehicles broke down.'
p2080
aS'Since the trucks were fitted with sensors and other technologies, they sent lots of data.'
p2081
aS'However, the data was hardly of any use due to the lack of a mechanism to analyse those in real time.'
p2082
aS'Infosys built a proof of concept, or PoC, using open source tools and technologies such as Hadoop and cloud-based hardware, which helped the company process tonnes of data and obtain meaningful insights.'
p2083
aS'Infosys applied the same technique to help a large bank draw meaningful insights from its huge volume of unstructured internal data.'
p2084
aS'Instead of creating a PoC for each customer, Infosys has now come out with something called Infosys Information Platform.'
p2085
aS'It is a standard framework which will allow it to do the PoC in a faster manner, even though the context in each case is different.'
p2086
aS"This approach, which Infosys has termed 'design thinking,' is one of the key elements of the strategy road map laid out by CEO Vishal Sikka after he joined the Bangalore-based company in June."
p2087
aS'It is not that platforms and products are something that Infosys has not tried earlier.'
p2088
aS'In fact, in the late 1980s, while working with one of its early clients, Reebok in France, Infosys had built a standard software package for distributor management.'
p2089
aS'Eventually, Reebok implemented this package known as Distributor Management Apparel Package in its worldwide operations.'
p2090
aS'However, despite the fact that there were hardly any standard ERP packages, or business management software, available those days, Infosys decided to stop focusing on the product owing to its bitter experience with Finacle, its banking software which was then known as Bancs 2000.'
p2091
aS'As Infosys embarks on the next phase of its journey under its first non-founder CEO, products and platforms are expected to play a major role.'
p2092
aS'"We believe that platforms will be a big thing in the long-term.'
p2093
aS'That\'s the way the industry is shifting and that\'s the way the consumers are consuming technology," says COO UB Pravin Rao.'
p2094
aS'"We expect a good percentage of our business to come from platforms in three to five years."'
p2095
aS'A good show\n\r\nSigns of change are already there.'
p2096
aS"The September quarter numbers of Infosys stand out from the rest of the pack in many ways, though they aren't the company's best."
p2097
aS'When expectations were running low, it delivered results good enough to rejuvenate the market, making it the darling of the street.'
p2098
aS"Infosys's revenue growth exceeded the consensus estimates: its dollar revenues grew 3.1 per cent sequentially, ahead of Cognizant's 2.5 per cent and HCL Technologies' 1.9 per cent."
p2099
aS"However, leader TCS's dollar revenue growth at 6.4 per cent was higher, which was expected."
p2100
aS"In terms of net profit (in dollars), Infosys was ahead of the pack with sequential growth of 6 per cent, against TCS's 3.2 per cent and HCL Technologies' 0.6 per cent."
p2101
aS'Cognizant reported a 4.3 per cent decline in net profit as it tried to absorb the cost of wage increases.'
p2102
aS'To top it all, the new Infosys leadership was seen filled with high optimism about growth prospects with no mention of "cautious optimism", which the previous regime uttered frequently.'
p2103
aS"However, experts are not yet ready to give full credit for the quarter's performance to the new management."
p2104
aS'"I think the only thing that Sikka has done up to this point is to restore morale and give both employees and customers a sense of confidence in the Infosys strategy," says Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of management consulting firm Everest Group.'
p2105
aS'"The strategy itself is largely unchanged and the organisation is also largely unaltered.'
p2106
aS'However, the improvement in morale is driving better execution, while the charismatic figurehead is opening client doors which had been closed under the previous leadership."'
p2107
aS"The new strategy, a part of which the company unveiled recently, entails Infosys earnestly trying to align with the customers' way of thinking."
p2108
aS'The company is vigorously going ahead with its "design thinking" campaign to ensure that it stays relevant by showing the customers the problem as well as the solution.'
p2109
aS'According to Rao, the new strategy is not radically different from the earlier one, though the company is trying to bring in a greater degree of focus on each of its businesses as well as on execution.'
p2110
aS'"Besides, some new thinking is being applied to make the execution of the strategy more vigorous," he adds.'
p2111
aS'In a recent interaction with the media, Sikka said that the new strategy aims at positioning the company as a "next-generation services company" with a focus on renewal of the core and innovation into new areas.'
p2112
aS'Under the new strategy, Infosys is planning to renew the existing systems and processes to make them more relevant to the emerging world and derive more value out of it.'
p2113
aS'The second dimension is about innovating into newer areas with design-led thinking, instead of just leveraging the cost arbitrage.'
p2114
aS'Apart from newer technologies like automation, robotics and machine learning, Infosys is laying emphasis on partnerships, whether with academic institutions or start-ups doing innovative work in niche technology areas.'
p2115
aS'"In addition to renewing all our existing service lines, we are also proposing adding new additional capabilities to that, like co-creation with the customers on design thinking," Sikka said.'
p2116
aS'The investor community is quite optimistic about the new leadership.'
p2117
aS'"When Sikka took over, Infosys was already in transition phase.'
p2118
aS'But definitely, there is improvement in investor sentiment in the recent past," says Sanjeev Hota, an analyst with brokerage house Sharekhan.'
p2119
aS'Besides, he says, what makes the new leadership stand out is its clarity of vision.'
p2120
aS'"For example, the company has assured to come out with its plan to use its cash (reserves) by April 2015, which is very encouraging," he adds.'
p2121
aS'But the new management knows that investor sentiment can be fickle.'
p2122
aS'"When NR Narayana Murthy returned (in 2013), we talked about the three-year journey.'
p2123
aS'We are now in the second year of that journey.'
p2124
aS'We are confident that at the end of the third year, we will be able to get back to what we call \'desirable Infosys\'," concludes Rao.'
p2125
aS'An era has ended in Infosys, one of the most outstanding Indian companies in the post-liberalistion era.'
p2126
aS'The last of the founders have bowed out and, what is more, asked to be considered as ordinary shareholders and not promoters.'
p2127
aS'Aside from the value that Infosys has created for its shareholders (its market capitalisation rose from Rs 30 crore in 1993 to Rs 2 lakh crore now), Infosys put India, associated most often with poverty and backwardness, on the global map of information technology (IT).'
p2128
aS'What is perhaps most fascinating is that Infosys was not the first large Indian IT company to raise its head, nor has it been the largest; but it has often shown a remarkable ability to market itself so that it has punched above its weight.'
p2129
aS'It managed to acquire a certain elan.'
p2130
aS'The Infosys story is so real because it has had its ups and downs.'
p2131
aS'Over the last few years it has fallen from its high pedestal for a number of reasons, foremost being losing it growth momentum and ability to charge a price premium over what the rest of the industry could command.'
p2132
aS'From being a company which always promised conservatively and then over-delivered, it repeatedly missed its own guidelines.'
p2133
aS'On top of this two governance issues stalked the company that was considered the role model till then.'
p2134
aS'It fell foul of US visa regulations and had to pay a large fine.'
p2135
aS'Worse, seeing the hard times the company had fallen into, the board brought back founding leader N R Narayana Murthy, who inducted his son into his personal team.'
p2136
aS'This led critics to ask how the company was any different from family-led concerns, even though Mr Murthy helped the company regain its value in the market as also show better results.'
p2137
aS'The good part of the story is that the company appears to have recovered as the founders bid final goodbye.'
p2138
aS'Mr Murthy has put in place a widely regarded successor at the top, Vishal Sikka, and has left the firm, along with his son.'
p2139
aS'Thus Mr Murthy has kept his word and removed one question over corporate governance practice.'
p2140
aS'A turning point has also been clearly marked out by the latest results - for the second quarter of the current year.'
p2141
aS'Net margins have recovered, taking the company back to the 2012-13 levels.'
p2142
aS'This has been achieved by simply tuning up things - cutting costs and improving delivery.'
p2143
aS'Utilisation levels are up.'
p2144
aS'Topline growth has not picked up but going by the number of new clients acquired and deals closed, rapid growth is foreseen in the next quarter onwards.'
p2145
aS'In view of all this, the guidance of 7-9 per cent topline growth for the current year seems conservative.'
p2146
aS'So the company appears to be back to being its old self.'
p2147
aS'Not all the issues have been addressed.'
p2148
aS'Attrition, for example, remains high which does not speak well of a workplace.'
p2149
aS"India owes a debt to Infosys' founders, who have written one of the few glorious chapters in India's corporate history."
p2150
aS'Infosys has decided to pull out of its proposed campus at the IT park near the Bengaluru International Airport citing lack of basic infrastructure such as road connectivity and water, but its plan to set up a large campus along the Sarjapur Road is still on.'
p2151
aS'According to sources, while the company has bought a major part of the 300 acres of land required for the campus directly from the sellers, it may also be facing the issues of road and water connectivity to the area.'
p2152
aS'Besides, in the absence of the availability of land banks by the government in that area, the procedure to acquire those directly from the farmers is also taking a lot of time.'
p2153
aS'Ramadas Kamath, executive vice-president of Infosys, who also looks after facilities and administration, declined to comment.'
p2154
aS'"We are optimistic that the Sarjapur Road campus will happen eventually," he said.'
p2155
aS'The plan to have a second campus in Bangalore on Sarjapur Road started seven years ago, even before it decided to apply to the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board for land at the Devanahalli IT Park near the international airport.'
p2156
aS'The company had plans to establish it as an IT special economic zone (SEZ), which would have functioned as its second and the largest campus in Bangalore.'
p2157
aS'According to sources, other than road connectivity, water continues to be the biggest problem for the companies that want to establish their presence in the IT Park at Devanahalli.'
p2158
aS'It is because the place is facing acute shortage of drinking water, while at the same time the water table is quite low.'
p2159
aS'In order to address the issue, the state government is learnt to have extended supplying recycled sewerage water.'
p2160
aS'"When you set up large campuses like this, you need minimum 50 litres of water per person; besides, you also need to have your own food courts which can\'t run on recycled sewerage water," said Kamath.'
p2161
aS'Alternatively, the state government had also proposed Infosys to give approval for digging its own bore wells.'
p2162
aS'The company declined the offer since boring in SEZ area is completely prohibited by the Central government.'
p2163
aS'Meanwhile, the Bangalore-based company is also seen rapidly expanding in cities outside Bangalore.'
p2164
aS'Already, Pune has become the largest campus for the company with a sitting capacity of 33,000 employees.'
p2165
aS'The government of Karnataka rushed into a series of decisions on Thursday to get Infosys, the information technology (IT) giant, to retract its decision to withdraw from the upcoming Devanahalli IT Park near the international airport.'

aS'We have already allotted 40 acres to Infosys at this park and reserved another 60 acres.'
p2168
aS'If the company wants more land, the department is ready to give it, Siddaramaiah told reporters after the meeting.'
p2169
aS'Earlier this month, Infosys said it had decided to withdraw from the IT Park, citing delay in completion of infrastructure.'

aS'The company has increased allocation to the innovation fund  which will invest in start-ups in automation, internet of things, collaboration and design  from $100 million to $500 million.'

aS'During his keynote address at the inaugural session at CeBit India, the local edition of the world\'s largest IT expo, in November last year, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka first expressed his "disappointment" with the Indian IT services industry.'
p2898
aS'He had spent a little over a hundred days at Infosys then, understanding the business and meeting clients, when he said that the industry needed to take a better direction.'
p2899
aS'"I was not deeply familiar with the services industry until recently," Sikka said.'
p2900
aS'"I find all of us in the industry on a downward spiral."'
p2901
aS'Cheaper manpower and currency arbitrage have been the unique selling proposition for the Indian IT services sector for decades now.'
p2902
aS'However, Sikka called these the "depressing reality" of the industry.'
p2903
aS'"It\'s like a treadmill of increasingly lower cost, hiring people faster and faster, from more and more mediocre places, training people less and less, putting them into job faster and faster.'
p2904
aS'I think that is a wrong direction."'
p2905
aS'Sikka has often said that the industry needs to focus on innovation and automation to "renew" itself.'
p2906
aS'Analysts attribute Sikka\'s "different thinking" to the fact that he comes with the "mindset of the software products" industry.'
p2907
aS'"He comes from a different background, having served in a products company where innovation is highly sought after," says Sanchit Vir Gogia of Greyhound Research.'
p2908
aS'"We believe that his intent of getting Infosys to a different position is a positive step but is not perceived in the correct manner since Infosys is a services company."'
p2909
aS"Still getting the hang of it\r\nGogia is reminded of a blogpost he had written in June, before Sikka's appointment was announced."
p2910
aS'The analyst had said that Infosys needed a "leader who truly understands the evolving IT services landscape" to overcome its problems: falling profitability and high employee turnover.'
p2911
aS'He had also said that the leader must understand the DNA of Infosys.'
p2912
aS'"We believe Sikka is still in a transition phase to win internal confidence and build the business for Infosys," Gogia observes.'
p2913
aS"Sikka's background in the software products sector, which works very differently from the traditional IT services business, was the first question that had been raised from all quarters when Infosys announced him as its CEO in June 2014."
p2914
aS"However, most analysts and experts were eager to give him a chance, considering Sikka's illustrious achievements in his role as the chief technology officer of SAP, the German enterprise solution major."
p2915
aS'While the Stanford-educated technocrat\'s ideas of design thinking and innovation have so far made several observers hopeful that he may bring fresh impetus to the slowing growth in the IT service sector, a few analysts have now begun to say they are "quite unsure" that will happen.'
p2916
aS"Additionally, some of Sikka's recent statements have got several experts talking."
p2917
aS'In reply to constant questioning about the nitty-gritties of Infosys\' performance at an analyst meet earlier this month, Sikka said: "Good things in life do not come in templates".'
p2918
aS'Even as analysts accepted the reply at that time, some later observed that working outside of templates might sound exciting for other industries but it\'s the "fixed processes" and "set practices" that have helped the IT services industry reach its current size of $118 billion.'
p2919
aS'Another analyst observes that Sikka\'s ideas would have excited him "had Infosys been a $500-million company".'
p2920
aS'"What he is saying could be very challenging to implement at the company\'s current size and scale.'
p2921
aS'It could well disrupt the company\'s current harmony," says a Mumbai-based analyst who had attended Infosys\' meet at its Pune campus, requesting anonymity.'
p2922
aS'"It is still a big risk," adds another analyst who has been tracking the company closely.'
p2923
aS'"During the analyst meet, Sikka shared several ambitious plans and ideas, but in some ways, he did not answer any question directly.'
p2924
aS'Maybe he has the answers to all those questions but does not want to bring much focus to them.'
p2925
aS'But there is also a possibility that he does not know the answers at all.'
p2926
aS'After all, he is very new to the IT services business."'
p2927
aS'The way to go\r\nIn a blogpost, greeting the 160,000 or so employees of Infosys for the New Year, Sikka yet again chose a rather unexpected path and suggested "new habits and behaviour", which if implemented might make 2015 a "year to remember" for the company.'
p2928
aS'While several other CEOs of traditional IT services companies would have talked about things like utilisation, client spending and hiring, Sikka asked employees to be "mindful" and "curious", to "speak up", and to "learn and teach".'
p2929
aS'He urged them to ask questions, challenge norms and review practices.'
p2930
aS"Additionally, at a time when most IT services CEOs are focused on ensuring that their companies get the largest pie of clients' budgets for the coming year, Sikka set a different tone in an interview with Phil Fersht, CEO of global advisory analyst firm HfS Research."
p2931
aS'He said the biggest challenge for Infosys in 2015 would be to bring about a cultural shift, and there was the need to "transform ourselves culturally and operationally into a company driven by innovation, driven by delivering much more value addition, more innovative services".'
p2932
aS'To achieve this, he said the company will need a "serious change" in mindset - in its offerings as well as in its operational processes.'
p2933
aS"While Sikka has time and again made it amply clear that Infosys will continue to be a services company, he has said that software will play a big role in the company's functioning going forward."
p2934
aS'"Changing a machine is easy but changing a human being is a totally different thing.'
p2935
aS'But I guess we will all have to wait and watch for now," says an analyst.'
p2936
aS'Despite these doubts, most analysts have chosen to be patient with Sikka, and are willing to give him six more months before passing judgment.'
p2937
aS'Infosys Chief Executive Vishal Sikka has set a target for holding face-to-face meetings with employees at the companys delivery centres across the world.'
p2938
aS'These are important for him, especially given the changes he is trying to bring to Indias second-biggest information technology services company.'
p2939
aS'As Bibhu Ranjan Mishra & Itika Sharma Punit meet Sikka for an interview, his excitement can be gauged from the fact that he does not forget to show a world map outlining the centres where these meeting are to be held.'
p2940
aS'He speaks about his journey at Infosys so far, the transformation happening within, and why it is important to find problems while providing solutions.'
p2941
aS'Edited excerpts:\nHow have your first five months at Infosys been?'
p2942
aS'It has been more than five months; 168 days.'
p2943
aS'I have just come back after a visit to all Infosys delivery centres (DCs) in the world, except Manila.'
p2944
aS'I am amazed at the positive energy; it is difficult to describe.'
p2945
aS'Also, the physical infrastructure of the company is astonishing... beyond what is visible, the way they operate, and the cleanliness, especially the innovation that has gone into making those environmentally sustainable!'
p2946
aS'I was on the Hyderabad campus, which is an SEZ.'
p2947
aS'It is still under construction but has been operational since 2010.'
p2948
aS'We are using radiant cooling there, and it is the first major corporate building to use this technology.'
p2949
aS'We cool the walls of the building with water and that cools the office.'
p2950
aS'So, even when it is 45-46 degrees celsius outside, especially in a place like Hyderabad, the temperature inside is always 25 degrees.'
p2951
aS'The national laboratories from the US have visited this place to see how it works.'
p2952
aS'Operationally, how has the business been in the first five months?'
p2953
aS'There is a lot of work to be done.'
p2954
aS'The company has become very big in the past 10 years  it has grown almost 10 times; that is an unbelievable pace of growth.'
p2955
aS'There, though, was a set of challenges that showed up, primarily around operational excellence.'
p2956
aS'Actually, the internal processes are a companys skeleton; these need to grow at a faster rate than the company.'
p2957
aS'So, an area that we are heavily focusing on is simplification of processes, and renovating & improving those.'
p2958
aS'And then there is the area of work.'
p2959
aS'When outsourcing was beginning 10-12 years ago, there was a tremendous amount of business.'
p2960
aS'You were only required to go and talk to the client for getting businesses.'
p2961
aS'That is not so anymore.'
p2962
aS'Sales operations have to improve.'
p2963
aS'These are not bad but need to be a lot more cost-competitive.'
p2964
aS'Talking of improvement, is it from your past experience or from the perspective of what rivals are doing?'
p2965
aS'From my own experience; having seen how operations can be made state-of-the-art.'
p2966
aS'I dont know what rivals are like, but I imagine they are more or less the same.'
p2967
aS'Another area that we need to focus on is proactivity  speaking up and bringing innovation to clients proactively.'
p2968
aS'There is a structural issue in this area, primarily because of the way companies have worked in the past  we (the industry) follow the instructions given.'
p2969
aS'Services, to a large extent, have been thriving on staff augmentation.'
p2970
aS'That has to completely shift towards delivering innovations.'
p2971
aS'A mind shift needs to take place, and that involves some degree of cultural change.'
p2972
aS'We are trained to use our knowledge to solve the existing problems.'
p2973
aS'We are not trained to find problems.'
p2974
aS'This has to change, because while problem-solving will become more automated, problem-finding is something where we can deliver a lot of value.'
p2975
aS'Lately, there has been a lot of concern over IT services companies laying off in large numbers?'
p2976
aS'Do you see a likely decine in hiring?'
p2977
aS'I think there still is tremendous growth that can be achieved.'
p2978
aS'We are not thinking about layoffs at all.'
p2979
aS'Revenue per employee can be improved over time but we will still need to hire a lot.'
p2980
aS'In India, we also have the additional responsibility to make sure there is employability.'
p2981
aS'It is a collective responsibility.'
p2982
aS'I dont see any need for layoffs.'
p2983
aS'Do you think lack of problem-finding ability is primarily due to the nature of our education system?'
p2984
aS'Typically, our education infrastructure does not make us good at learning.'
p2985
aS'We learn many things that we feel we have to for a grade.'
p2986
aS'But we are not taught how to frame and nurture our curiosity, how to become better builders.'
p2987
aS'We dont talk about finding problems.'
p2988
aS'My younger son is seven years old.'
p2989
aS'Whenever I sit with him, he usually drives me crazy with complicated questions.'
p2990
aS'Once he asked what was the biggest number; I had to explain the concept of infinity.'
p2991
aS'On another occasion, he woke up and asked is there something bigger than infinity...'
p2992
aS'There is curiosity till we are 7-9 years old.'
p2993
aS'After that, we get so bogged down by the educational system that we somehow abandon that curiosity.'
p2994
aS'When you moved to the US for higher studies, how different did you find the education system there?'
p2995
aS'I learnt the hard way when I went to Stanford.'
p2996
aS'I asked my PhD advisor what he wanted me to work on?'
p2997
aS'He said: I have no idea; you are supposed to find your own problems and decide what you want to work on.'
p2998
aS'This was a bit of a shock for me.'
p2999
aS'Around the same time, I learnt about John McCarthy, considered the father of Artificial Intelligence.'
p3000
aS'He had the notion that finding and articulating the problem is half the solution.'
p3001
aS'To me, it was a big revelation.'
p3002
aS'There was another professor, Bob Floyd, one of the pioneers of computer science who wrote Floyds algorithm.'
p3003
aS'He used to say solving a problem is not just the end... once you find the problem and precisely articulate it, there is a need to go back and check if there is a need to change the definition because of the solution.'
p3004
aS'And then you keep on improving the solution until it can no longer be improved.'
p3005
aS'So, the depth at which people have understood problem-solving and problem-finding is still not reflected in our educational system in India.'
p3006
aS'As a part of a new strategy, you have been talking about renew and new.'
p3007
aS'Which are the businesses that you have already renewed?'
p3008
aS'We are automating the business-enabling functions to improve productivity.'
p3009
aS'We are bringing this to the top 25 accounts in each segment.'
p3010
aS'So, the renewal has to be done in every project and every team... We have been training everybody on design thinking.'
p3011
aS'There are more than 9,000 people who have gone through the design-thinking training.'
p3012
aS'Last week, I rolled out a plan to bring design thinking to every Infosys employee over the next 12 months.'
p3013
aS'Even as the new things that you talk about have excited several observers, there are bits of concerns because of their difference from the past.'
p3014
aS'Is there a risk involved in the new direction?'
p3015
aS'I never thought that way.'
p3016
aS'To me, the alternative direction, in which a large part of the industry seems to be heading, is becoming more cost-competitive, hiring people faster and in large numbers  even at the cost of quality.'
p3017
aS'I think that is the wrong direction.'
p3018

p3293
aS'Also, the fact that TCS derives higher revenue from Europe (27.8 per cent of revenues) than Infosys (24 per cent of revenues) means the former is more impacted by adverse cross-currency moves.'

p3295
aS"On profitability, too, TCS's Ebit (earnings before interest, tax) margins expanded by 20 basis points to 27 per cent, while Infosys was up 63 basis points to 26.7 per cent due to a favourable rupee and utilisation."

p3323
aS'We are trying to improve the work atmosphere for our teams.'
p3324
aS'Sometimes people quit not because they dont see growth, but because they are frustrated with certain processes.'

p3326
aS'Will you be hiring fewer people with increasing automation and use of new collaborative technologies?'
p3327
aS'Hiring is a function of productivity, attrition, growth and so on.'
p3328
aS'The innovation in productivity improvement will take some time, though we have started talking about taking it to the next level of automation.'

p3335
aS'Employee utilisation will differ from quarter to quarter.'
p3336
aS'In the previous quarter it was high but in January-March there will be an influx of new employees and so utilisation might be lower.'

aS'Even before (chief executive officer) Vishal (Sikka) came in, we were aggressive.'
p3357
aS'We were conservative, but in the last couple of years, we tried to be more aggressive.'
p3358
aS'Probably we will look at (acquiring) technologies more closely than we did.'

aS'The number one user of H-1B visas is bringing in over 6,000 new workers each year.'
p3790
aS'The top ten companies that use the H-1B programme swallow up over 50 per cent of the supply of available visas.'
p3791
aS'Instead of just increasing the supply of visas, real reforms are needed, he argued.'
p3792
aS'Why we in Congress would simply increase the supply for foreign workers without adding more protections for American workers.'
p3793
aS'Claims by US businesses that there just arent enough US workers willing and able to take these skilled jobs fall flat when we read stories about recent big layoffs in the tech industry, he said.'
p3794
aS'Bills have been introduced that seemingly ignore the plight of US workers.'
p3795
aS'Some bills would increase the annual number of H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000, or as high as 195,000 per year.'
p3796
aS'This only makes the problem worse.'
p3797
aS'It doesnt close the loopholes or prevent abuse.'
p3798
aS'It doesnt make sure that American workers are put before foreign workers.'
p3799
aS'It only increases the supply of cheaper foreign labour, Grassley said.'
p3800
aS'Grassley alleged that over the years the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over rather than complement the US workforce.'
p3801
aS'Even though the annual H-1B cap is 65,000, the actual number of foreign workers coming in through the program is much more because of numerous exemptions.'
p3802
aS'For example, in Fiscal Year 2014, the agency in charge approved 315,857 H-1B petitions, he said.'
p3803
aS'Sharing concerns of Grassley, the Committees Ranking Member, Patrick Leahy, said he and many other Senators have heard consistently about the need for improvements to these programs to ensure that US companies can attract world-class talent and continue to lead on the global stage.'
p3804
aS'We have also heard troubling stories of abuses that have caused the displacement of American workers.'
p3805
aS'These visa programmes must be used to complement the US workforce, not displace it, he said.'
p3806
aS'In a change of long-term strategy, Infosys has unveiled an active programme of growth through acquisition, something it was shy of in its more conservative past.'
p3807
aS'Infosys made an acquisition as far back as in 2003 of an Australian entity for $23 million.'
p3808
aS'Thereafter, its acquisition tickets had not crossed the two-digit mark till 2011.'
p3809
aS'It is only since 2012 that the software leader has made acquisitions worth over $200 million.'
p3810
aS'The important point about its current strategy is that it will acquire not just niche companies, which bring specific capabilities and technologies like consulting or digital prowess but also business volumes in geographies and verticals with scope for rapid growth.'
p3811
aS'It is, therefore, not surprising that a brokerage has projected a doubling of its revenue growth rate from the current seven-nine per cent in dollar terms to 15 per cent in two years to 2016-17.'
p3812
aS'The firming up of an active acquisitions agenda is the result of not just the recent change in the leadership of the company with the coming in of Vishal Sikka at the top but also increased shareholder clamour for higher payout.'
p3813
aS'Two former chief financial officers of the company have recently proposed a share buyback to bring down the Rs 30,000-crore cash pile that the company is sitting on and improve shareholder value.'
p3814
aS'The acquisition route is necessary for two reasons.'
p3815
aS'Like all large technology firms, it is high time Infosys launched a programme for securing access to new technology through regular buyout of start-ups in order to strengthen itself.'
p3816
aS'Besides, with the developed economies in a secular slowdown mode, there will be no scope for relying on demand from them for rapid growth at anywhere near earlier levels.'
p3817
aS'So it is growth through acquisitions that will matter more henceforth.'
p3818
aS'But what is most needed to ensure truly long-term growth is looking more carefully at the Indian market.'
p3819
aS"India accounted for less than three per cent of Infosys's revenue in the last financial year whereas Tata Consultancy Services, the industry leader, clocked India sales of twice that level at under seven per cent."
p3820
aS'Since China and India will over time emerge as the main engines of growth in global demand, Indian information technology leaders cannot simply go on remaining wholly focused on the developed economy markets.'
p3821
aS"The domestic economy accounts for a majority of the revenue of China's software sector."
p3822
aS"The problems of doing business in India are well known and not peculiar to the software industry, but given India's low information technology penetration, be it in the use of credit cards or access to the internet, the market needs to be developed."
p3823
aS'Nandan Nilekani, former Infosys chief, played a major role in taking the use of information technology in India forward by being able to sell the idea of biometric identification to leaders across the political spectrum.'
p3824
aS'The present leaders of the cash-rich Indian information technology companies may have to tell their shareholders to be ready for lower earnings growth as the firms promote the growth of information technology in a market that is still far from entirely literate, quite poor and not well connected.'
p3825
aS'Infosys, Indias second-largest information technology (IT) services company, has said Ritika Suri will be responsible for managing the $500-million Innovation Fund.'
p3826
aS'She presently heads its mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) initiatives.'
p3827
aS'An official said, "Later, we may look at having a person under her to manage the fund."'
p3828
aS'In January, the Bengaluru-based company had decided to hand the charge of M&A; to Suri, after giving the former M&A; head, Deepak Padaki, the charge of strategy.'
p3829
aS'At that point, it had said, it was looking at having a separate leader to manage the fund.'
p3830
aS'Suri had joined Infosys previous year from SAP, a German enterprise software maker.'
p3831
aS'Of the $500 million that Infosys has set aside for the Innovation Fund, half is for Indian start-ups.'
p3832
aS'The company has already made two investments out of the fund, including $15 million in a spin-off company of animation studio, DreamWorks Animation.'
p3833
aS'Recently, the company said it had made investment in another company, which makes cloud-enabled devices for detecting air quality.'
p3834
aS'However, it is yet to disclose the quantum of the investment and the name of the company.'
p3835
aS'Infosys has identified certain areas like artificial intelligence, automation, Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics as its focus areas for engagements in the start-up world.'
p3836
aS'"The great IT needs of the world are increasingly being served by thousands of smaller companies.'
p3837
aS'Yet, bigger businesses not quite trust the small companies.'
p3838
aS'We see ourselves playing an important role - first of all by investing in those start-ups and participating in their financial success and also in helping bridge the gap between the start-ups and the large businesses, give the businesses comfort, the resilience and maturity," Sikka had said, addressing a recent conference organised by Morgan Stanley, earlier this month.'
p3839
aS'With Suri as the head of M&A;, Infosys has already shown its intent to play an aggressive inorganic growth strategy.'

aS'Infosys Limited is targeting around 900 clients globally for its IAP (Infosys Automation Platform), according to Shyam Doddavula, assistant vice president and principal product architect at Infosys.'
p3842
aS'The IAP enabled us to create intelligent robots, who are resolving incidents related to customers orders for a large telco.'
p3843
aS'It saved $1.3 million to the client.'
p3844
aS'IAP is being leveraged by 18 clients at present.'
p3845
aS'And, 900 clients are in the pipeline," he said.'
p3846
aS'Demonstrating IAP at Hysea summit here, he said all IT systems would be moving towards self-healing platforms like IAP.'
p3847
aS'Doddavula said while 60 per cent of the IT budget of a large enterprise was spent on just keeping the lights on, over 30 per cent of IT operations work in repetitive and was still being done manually.'
p3848
aS'The solution is to build an intelligent robot, he said, adding IAP, offered on a managed services model, was 30-70 per cent faster and cheaper.'
p3849
aS'Offshore Infosys employees would get an average pay rise of around 6.5 per cent this year, while high performers could get as much as nine per cent, according to sources.'
p3850
aS'Infosys is Indias second largest information technology (IT) company.'
p3851
aS'The range of salary revisions offered indicates the revision in the sector would be in the same range this year as last year.'
p3852
aS'For onshore employees, who are located outside  India, the average hike this year is around two per cent.'
p3853
aS'Last year, the company had given a rise of between six and seven per cent for offshore employees and between one and two per cent for onshore ones.'
p3854
aS'Infosys usually gives a wage rise to employees every April.'
p3855
aS'The increase in salary will be effective from April 1.'
p3856
aS'After the new chief executive officer and managing director, Vishal Sikka, assumed charge in August last year, Infosys has initiated several measures to arrest rising attrition.'
p3857
aS'In the December quarter of this financial year, the attrition rate was 20.1 per cent, about 20 percentage points less than the previous quarter.'
p3858

aS'Infosys, Indias second-largest information technology services company, was expected to see stronger revenue growth in 2015-16 and 2016-17, because of its offerings, as well as improved client mining, brokerage firm CLSA said in a report on Tuesday.'
p3860
aS'It predicted Infosys would more than double its dollar revenue growth in 2016-17 to 15 per cent from seven per cent in 2014-15.'
p3861
aS'Infosys is yet to announce its 2014-15 results, but it had provided a revenue growth forecast of seven-nine per cent for the year.'
p3862
aS'With the new management, Infosys should see stronger revenue growth in FY16-17, as it gains leadership in digital and traditional services, while improving client mining, the CLSA report said.'

p3866
aS'Confirming this, a senior official of Infosys said this is part of the proposals to hold board meetings in cities which house large delivery centres for the company which will also give a scope to the employees to interact with the senior management in a regular interval.'
p3867

p3868
aS'SMAC/digital services offerings account for 10 per cent of Infosys revenue, and these are growing 30 per cent year on year.'
p3869
aS'The brokerage firm said it expected Infosys to consolidate its profit margin in 2015-16 and expand it in 2016-17.'
p3870
aS'By shifting to the provision of offshore services and raising utilisation, it has seen margin recovery, which can be maintained by re-aligning the organisation for new disruptive services, raising billing rates, reducing its reliance on subcontractors and increasing utilisation and automation while reducing attrition, the report said.'
p3871
aS'In the quarter ended December 31, 2014, Infosys profit margin was 26.7 per cent, an expansion of 60 basis points (a basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point) from the previous quarter.'

p3873
aS"Infosys, the country's second-largest information technology (IT) services company, is looking at a two-pronged acquisition strategy."
p3874
aS'It would continue to pursue smaller companies for primarily innovative technology.'

aS'And, keep its radar active for relatively large acquisitions, to help it expand scale in certain regions, divisions, or service lines.'
p3876
aS'The Bengaluru-based company expects the acquisition size of next-generation tech companies  as of Panaya, the US-based automation technology company it recently acquired  would be smaller, in the absence of larger companies in these space.'
p3877
aS'However, acquisitions which it expects will enhance presence in a particular region or business segment are bound to be bigger, maybe upwards of $500 million.'
p3878
aS"Such acquisitions will only be to help in 'accelerating the presence it already has, U B Pravin Rao, chief operating officer (COO), told Business Standard."
p3879
aS'We already have presence in geographies and many of the verticals, he explained.'
p3880
aS'Rao said there was no fixed limit on how much to pay.'
p3881
aS'If we have something in (annual) revenues of $100 mn or more, we would be open to look at that and if it is a $500-mn acquisition or something that makes sense, we are open to that, he added.'
p3882
aS'Infosys has so far made six acquisitions.'
p3883
aS'Panaya, mentioned earlier, is a US-headquartered but Israel-based automation technologies provider.'
p3884
aS'It acquired Panaya last month, in an all-cash deal of $200 mn ( nearly Rs 1,250 crore).'
p3885
aS'This is its second largest acquisition.'
p3886
aS'The largest was of Lodestone, a Zurich-headquartered management consulting entity, which it bought for $345 mn (close to Rs 1,950 crore) in September 2012.'
p3887
aS"Infosys is now in the process of integrating Panaya's capabilities with itself, to implement the formers automation technologies in the existing process."
p3888
aS'In the second phase, it would try to use Panayas platform itself to improve internal efficiency and enhance productivity.'
p3889
aS'The expectation is that over a period, once the teams are fully integrated and our team fully understands the capabilities of Panaya, we will start implementing in our projects and in our solutioning for clients, Rao added.'
p3890

aS'Industry experts believe Sikka is seeking to underline an impression that Infosys is no more a conservative Indian company but a truly global one.'

p4802
aS'In Western companies, you have a degree of operating processes and systems.'
p4803
aS'But here (at Infosys), we are not even close to it (when it comes to) the basic operational systems, efficiencies.'
p4804
aS'Surprising thing is that people have told me Infosys is the standard bearer for these processes in India.'
p4805
aS'But from what I see, we are far behind on forecasting, pipeline building, (and) ability to do real-time reporting.'
p4806
aS'Since Mr. (N.R.'
p4807
aS'Narayana) Murthy (Infosys co-founder) left 10 years ago, there is a sense that I get for the last several years, even as the company grew a lot in terms of employees and business, the internal process did not keep pace with it.'

p4849
aS'Of course, by September 2016, Infosys will be able to come to industry-matching growth numbers.'
p4850
aS'Have I been over-promising?'
p4851
aS'Of course not.'
p4852
aS'There is sense of excitement about what we can do.'
p4853
aS'And this has been our consistent commentary.'
p4854
aS'There (have) been a lot of internal initiatives (that) we have undertaken.'
p4855
aS'The market believes the company is positioning itself uniquely and your comments over the last several months suggest that the model followed by your peers is dead and Infosys is working towards something new.'
p4856
aS'You concede that your comments on this entire strategy of new and renew have been a tad misinterpreted, which has actually led to huge expectations?'
p4857
aS'Are you kidding?'
p4858
aS'(laughs).'
p4859
aS'I dont agree.'
p4860
aS'I did not create the perception, actually.'
p4861
aS'I wish I could spend more time on the new.'
p4862
aS'I live for the new stuff (laughs).'
p4863
aS'I wish I dont have to get into how our top 15 accounts are doing.'
p4864
aS'I focus on renew entirely.'
p4865
aS'You know, I was in Delhi almost a year back, in June, when I asked how many projects are under way at Infosys.'
p4866
aS'It took the team four-five weeks to assemble this data in one spreadsheet.'
p4867
aS'Since then, every Saturday, I get a spreadsheet on every project that is under way.'
p4868
aS'In my first quarter, which was the second quarter for the company, I was on phone calls with customers preventing ramp-downs.'
p4869
aS'So there was this particular client, where I saw there would be a $9 million ramp-down.'
p4870
aS'We saw that.'
p4871
aS'And I had to speak with them to see what we could do to help them.'
p4872
aS'Because we saw that this could have negative impact.'
p4873
aS'I would have had to do this for its effect would be on third quarter.'
p4874
aS'So anybody who says the focus in not on renew, he should be fired.'
p4875
aS'Because 99% of business is from renew.'
p4876
aS'So for now, what keeps you awake at night?'
p4877
aS'Well, my first concern is that when Mr. Murthy was here, he had built a company whose offerings were so differentiated that there was basically no sales requirement.'
p4878
aS'Nandan (Nilekani, Murthys successor as CEO) used to have deep CEO level connects.'
p4879
aS'So you had to say you were from Infosys, there was no competition, no fight.'
p4880
aS'The traditional sales culture is not there.'
p4881
aS'Sales operational excellence is not there... for the last few years, it has not been the case.'
p4882
aS'Clients have opened their own shared service centres... And some companies especially, Cognizant (Technology Solutions Corp.), have world-class sales and marketing.'
p4883
aS'That has created a highly competitive environment.'
p4884
aS'The issue which keeps me awake at night is to get that go-to-market side back.'
p4885
aS'So what are you doing to address some of these challenges?'
p4886
aS'In the near term, we have taken basic measures.'
p4887
aS'Sales team, we have brought down to five verticals which are global in nature.'
p4888
aS'Sales training has happened.'
p4889
aS'Delivery is not with them.'
p4890
aS'For top 15 accounts, the top three in each account, we have taken responsibility: the CEOs office.'
p4891
aS'So by we, I mean Deepak (Deepak Padaki, vice-president, strategy, and chief risk officer), Ranga (Ranganath D. Mavinakere, executive vice-president and head of strategic operations), Ritika (Ritika Suri, head of mergers and acquisitions) and me.'
p4892
aS'So I basically supervise them.'
p4893
aS'The primary addition we do is that I can intervene.'
p4894
aS'I know the clients.'
p4895
aS'So I can talk to them.'
p4896
aS'With these 15, I can do in a focused way.'
p4897
aS'You can connect the dots better.'
p4898
aS'Being in the central place, you can connect the dots.'
p4899
aS'We want to teach the teams at the top of the pyramid to get these connecting-the-dots better.'
p4900
aS'What other measures are you taking to generate more business or, say, win new clients?'
p4901
aS'We are opening new channels of business.'
p4902
aS'We are not just responding to requests but being proactive, and we have already won some mega deals, influenced by design thinking, in just six weeks since we launched it.'
p4903
aS'The other one we have done is with consulting.'
p4904
aS'To say they worked in silos, that is putting it mildly.'
p4905
aS'These consulting leaders, along with the sales leadership, will (now) have strategic engagements with clients.'
p4906
aS'We have incentivized them to grow the Infosys business in a meaningful way.'
p4907
aS'They have become design thinkers.'
p4908
aS'Every turnaround is scripted by a team.'
p4909
aS'Do you believe you have the right team?'
p4910
aS'Absolutely.'
p4911
aS'Pravin manages it from here and I can travel and meet clients.'
p4912
aS'Ravi (S. Ravi Kumar, head of delivery), Ranga is for strategy.'
p4913
aS'But there is incredible fixation with SAP.'
p4914
aS'(Several executives of Sikkas former employer have joined Infosys)\nBut 16 senior executives from SAP have joined you.'
p4915
aS'See, many of these people had already left (SAP) or were taking time off.'
p4916
aS'Some of them were laid off.'
p4917
aS'I did not ask a single executive to join me.'
p4918
aS'They wanted to join.'
p4919
aS'Also, other than Michael (Michael Reh, head of Finacle and Edgeverve), nobody runs a line of business.'
p4920
aS'Infosys said it has set a target to touch $20 billion in revenue at a 30% operating margin and $80,000 revenue per employee by 2020.'
p4921
aS'The company ended the last fiscal with an operating margin of 26% and revenue per employee of $52,500.'
p4922
aS'Are the targets achievable?'
p4923
aS'It should be looked as more of a guidepost.'
p4924
aS'We want 10% of the business in 2020 to come from the new areasworking with start-ups, new kinds of applications and platforms.'
p4925
aS'These areas would give us $2 billion in revenue by then.'
p4926
aS'We would like $1.5 billion from acquisitions we make between now and then.'
p4927
aS'About $16.5 billion would come from renewing the existing business, a result of design thinking, innovation culture and zero distance coming into every project.'
p4928
aS'That means growing at 13%.'
p4929
aS'That, I think, is very much achievable.'
p4930
aS'Out of the three goals, $80,000 (revenue per employee) is easiest to achieve.'
p4931
aS'How do you see the road ahead with all these measures you have implemented?'
p4932
aS'Im vastly more confident and comfortable about the future.'
p4933
aS'Most people do not really understand what it was like (in the company) when I started.'
p4934
aS'We needed to stabilize then.'
p4935
aS'And now we all are excited.'
p4936
aS'People are excited because they know they are involved in something great.'
p4937
aS'The gravity of the situation was far worse (then)...'
p4938
aS'I have found that instilling confidence in the team was the main thing then.'
p4939
aS'And now, since we mentioned bread and butter outsourcing deals, (let me tell you something about) the outcome of projects, I got my hands on 7-8 projects earlier in January, because it appealed to me.'
p4940
aS'It took several months to go through those projects.'
p4941
aS'Somebody wrote that Im managing 1,000 projects, which is not possible.'
p4942
aS'Some stupid human being, if he can say that he can manage 1,000 projects, he should be fired.'
p4943
aS'So 7-8 projectsin each of them, there were very interesting things we could do.'
p4944
aS'We identified a very basic pattern how we could improve a project.'
p4945
aS'So we added three improvements in each of the seven projects and we (made a) template (of this) into a five-point thing and we rolled out to the first 1,000 project managers.'
p4946
aS'Could you walk us through on how you identify, evaluate and finally invest in a start-up?'
p4947
aS'Say AirViz, the Carnegie Mellon University spun-off air quality monitoring sensor firm.'
p4948
aS'Roughly 80% of the time, you run into the companies, and they come to you 20% of the time, you see something and say, hey, thats very interesting.'
p4949
aS'In the case of AirViz, it was just a very serendipitous connecting of the dots.'
p4950
aS'We had a two-day design session with a mining company in Palo Alto, and they told us that air quality in the mines is a huge problem.'
p4951
aS'(It was also at the time) when Beijing was shut down for three days because of bad air quality.'
p4952
aS'I met Illah (Illah R. Nourbakhsh, head of robotics at Carnegie Mellon) and I asked him what are you working on?'
p4953
aS'(And then he told me that he has this air quality monitoring start-up).'
p4954
aS'We were walking out already, and I said, oh, wait wait wait, tell me more about this.'
p4955
aS'Wipro, Indias third-largest information technology (IT) services company, announced a salary increase for its employees largely in line with those offered by its peers.'
p4956
aS'The Azim Premji-led company, which follows a June appraisal cycle, said the average increase in salary for employees located in offshore locations was in the range of seven per cent while for those in onshore locations it was two per cent.'
p4957
aS'For high-performers, the quantum of raise was substantially higher, Saurabh Govil, global head (human resources), Wipro, said in a statement.'
p4958
aS'The revised salary will be effective June 1.'
p4959
aS'Infosys has already increased compensation packages with effect from April 1.'
p4960
aS'In case of Infosys, the average increase for the offshore employees was 6.5 per cent while for onshore, it was two per cent, similar to what Wipro announced.'
p4961
aS'Infosys high-performers were given an average wage hike of around nine per cent.'
p4962
aS'In April, Indias largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) also increased employee salaries.'
p4963
aS'While for offshore employees, the average raise was eight per cent, those located in onsite locations got a raise of around two per cent.'
p4964
aS'Among large offshore-centric IT services companies, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant is yet to come out with numbers.'
p4965
aS'Company sources said the process is on and is expected to be announced with effect from July 1.'
p4966
aS'Apart from the wage increases, Wipro has tweaked the compensation structure for employees at junior and middle management level by enhancing fixed-pay component in their salaries.'
p4967
aS'This is expected to improve their take-home salary.'
p4968
aS'In the sector, the variable component in the salary is quite high, and in some cases it is as high as 50 per cent of the overall pay packet.'
p4969
aS'In 2013, a similar exercise was carried out by its cross-town peer Infosys with an aim of increasing the fixed component in the salary.'
p4970
aS'As on March 31, Wipro had 158,217 employees for its IT services business.'
p4971
aS'The company, of late, is trying to de-link revenue growth from headcount by rolling out automation tools and technologies like cognitive intelligence platform, Holmes.'

aS'Raj Jain wears two hats, as President of Walmart India and Managing Director & CEO of Bharti Walmart, the cash-and-carry joint venture.'
p4973
aS'In an interview with Business Standard, he dwells on the points raised by a government discussion paper on allowing foreign investment in multi-brand retail, and discusses plans on cash-and-carry.'
p4974
aS'Edited excerpts:\nHave you started preparing the blueprint for rolling out Walmart India stores, now that the government has released the discussion paper?'
p4975
aS'It is still a discussion paper.'
p4976
aS'But it does prepare sufficient ground for entry into multi-brand retail, with a very relevant tone and tenor.'
p4977
aS'Is majority holding in the Indian venture a pre-condition for Walmarts entry into the market?'
p4978
aS'No.'
p4979
aS'Our position would be that the government should open it fully (allow 100 per cent foreign investment).'
p4980
aS'However, we fully understand that the government wants to adopt a calibrated approach, as it has in other industries such as telecom.'
p4981
aS'We are willing to work with the government and demonstrate the benefits of modern retail to the country\nWill you be comfortable with less than 26 per cent stake, given the rules in India?'
p4982
aS'Allowing less than 26 per cent is like not opening at all.'
p4983
aS'Shareholding below 26 per cent does not give any rights.'
p4984
aS'I am sure the government is cognizant of that.'
p4985
aS'The question will be between a 100 per cent, a 51 per cent and 49 per cent and, may be, 26 per cent.'
p4986
aS'But nowadays, the difference between 26 per cent and 49 per cent is hardly anything.'
p4987
aS'On a calibrated approach, the government also wants multi-brand retail chains set up through the help of foreign capital to open stores only in cities with a population of one million or more.'
p4988
aS'Is such an approach an impediment?'
p4989
aS'Yes, it is.'
p4990
aS'There are only 42 or 43 cities above the one million mark.'
p4991
aS'So, it reduces the landscape to a significant level.'
p4992
aS'One million is a very high number.'
p4993
aS'Also, getting real estate in these large towns is a big challenge.'
p4994
aS'Once you develop a back-end infrastructure, which the government wants us to do, then you have to spread it in the same geography, as much as possible, because India is a very large country.'
p4995
aS'Our own preference and recommendation would be 100,000.'
p4996
aS'If that is considered too low, then 500,000 is probably a good number.'
p4997
aS'Is it a good idea to give you rights to operate in certain states, say, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, which will be like a circle in case of telecom?'
p4998
aS'It makes business sense.'
p4999
aS'Walmart may want to do things in the North, while our competitors may want to focus on the South.'
p5000
aS'But I dont know if it makes legislative sense, because we are not a federally-run country.'
p5001
aS'We need to have the same law for all states.'
p5002
aS'A regional approach makes better sense because it is very difficult to develop infrastructure everywhere: it takes a lot of time, effort and money to do it.'
p5003
aS'There is also a suggestion in the discussion paper to put in place some norms on sourcing.'
p5004
aS'Is that an impediment, too?'
p5005
aS'For our current businesses of supply and cash-and-carry, we are sourcing almost 90 per cent of our products locally.'
p5006
aS'So, its not that its a big issue.'
p5007
aS'It also helps develop the local supply base, not just for India but global.'
p5008
aS'There is a suggestion to allocate half the inflow in creation of infrastructure.'
p5009
aS'In the initial years, do retailers like you invest more or less than what has been suggested?'
p5010
aS'In the initial years, it could actually be higher.'
p5011
aS'It depends on the country and the level of infrastructure.'
p5012
aS'In India, infrastructure is relatively not so developed.'
p5013
aS'So, 50 per cent or thereabouts would probably be a good figure.'
p5014
aS'But rather than mandating investment in the back-end, the government could look at some other parameters also, to ensure serious players are there in the market.'
p5015
aS'It is a bit like opening the auto industry: you dont direct that you have to necessarily put factories.'
p5016
aS'You cant make an automobile without a factory and you cant run an automobile business without a factory.'
p5017
aS'Whereas, a lot of attention gets focused on front-end stores, no global retailer can be successful unless it has a very strong back-end.'
p5018
aS'What do you make of this suggestion in the discussion paper that retailers may be asked to seek permission from a central regulator for opening every outlet?'
p5019
aS'Doesnt it look like macro-management?'
p5020
aS'I dont think it will work in our country.'
p5021
aS'It is like going back to the 1940s or the fifties.'
p5022
aS'A central regulator is not required.'
p5023
aS'For opening any store, there are 30 licences required.'
p5024
aS'Those are, by-and-large, given by the state government.'
p5025
aS'So, it should be mandated to the states to put in place an appropriate regulatory mechanism, a single-window one.'
p5026
aS'As a global player, dont you also want comfort from the states that they will not clamp down on certain chains or on organised retail as a whole?'
p5027
aS'Yes, of course.'
p5028
aS'But as we have seen in manufacturing and other sectors, states which do discourage modernisation, foreign investment or progress, tend to suffer and those governments probably do not stay in power for too long.'
p5029
aS'The democratic process will take care of this.'
p5030
aS'We dont need any specific assurance to that effect.'
p5031
aS'How many cash-and-carry stores should we expect from you in the coming months?'
p5032
aS'We will open about 10-12 cash-and-carry stores in the next 12 to 18 months.'
p5033
aS'Work is under way on all these sites.'
p5034
aS'These will be all over the North and some in the South.'
p5035
aS'How much revenue have you started generating from India?'
p5036
aS'Its very difficult to say.'
p5037
aS'Has your total sourcing from India reached the $1-billion mark yet?'
p5038
aS'No, not yet.'
p5039
aS'Sanjay Bhandarkar, managing director, Rothschild (India), tells Sumit Sharma and Abhineet Kumar that private equity investments may rise as much as 50 per cent this year, compared with $2.8 billion last year, as overseas investor sense opportunities for organic growth and valuations seem more realistic.'
p5040
aS'Edited excerpts:\nWhat kind of opportunities do you see in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and financial advisory businesses this year?'
p5041
aS'We are seeing a lot of traction on the inbound.'
p5042
aS'Many multi-national companies (MNCs) are coming into the country to buy control in businesses, or share it by way of partnerships.'
p5043
aS'There is some selective amount of outbound M&As.'
p5044
aS'We are also seeing a pick up on the private equity funding front.'
p5045
aS'One will see a lot more deals.'
p5046
aS'Though the level of deal closures does not match the level of activity, it will catch on.'
p5047
aS'What amount may come as private equity this year?'
p5048
aS'Its very difficult to put up a figure, given the nature of the industry.'
p5049
aS'But, one could see 40-50 per cent year-on-year growth.'
p5050
aS'Which sectors you think will see more activity?'
p5051
aS'We dont see any single sector outperforming.'
p5052
aS'Sectors like telecom are large.'
p5053
aS'If something happens there, the deal size will be so huge that the value will become disproportionately large.'
p5054
aS'In terms of volumes, it will be across the board.'
p5055
aS'Some action might be seen in telecom, power, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and industrials.'
p5056
aS'Sale of shares in the first half of 2010 is about thrice that in last year.'
p5057
aS'Still, over the past few months, issuances have tapered off.'
p5058
aS'What is your outlook for the remaining year?'
p5059
aS'We are not in the capital market, so its difficult to comment.'
p5060
aS'It will be a function of volatility, which has clearly increased in the last two months due to global economic threats from Europe and the slowing growth in the US.'
p5061
aS'Its showing up in the moderation of appetite among portfolio investors.'
p5062
aS'We speak to investors with a slightly longer-term horizon  private equity or strategic investors.'
p5063
aS'Since public markets are soft, it creates opportunities for deals, as alternative sources of funding would be required.'
p5064
aS'The capital market is unlikely to impact the real economy and growth will continue to be strong.'
p5065
aS'Even if there is some volatility in global markets, the underlying conditions are strong, liquidity is easy and rates havent risen sharply.'
p5066
aS'Hence, the economic impact should be limited and will set the stage for more long-term capital to come in.'
p5067
aS'Sumitomo Mitsui plans to buy a stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank.'
p5068
aS'With Japanese banks holding huge surplus of money, do you see this as an emerging trend?'
p5069
aS'One could see that happening, especially with Japanese banks, which have enough money and need to go out, and less with the European and American banks, which may need to put their houses in order.'
p5070
aS'Do you see consolidation in sectors like banking, telecom?'
p5071
aS'Consolidation is inevitable in the telecom sector.'
p5072
aS'When it happens, is a billion-dollar question.'
p5073
aS'In banking, it could be marginal, except if the government decides it wants to consolidate public sector banking.'
p5074
aS'One will see smaller deals in the private sector.'
p5075
aS'What do you think about bids at the recent telecom auctions?'
p5076
aS'Were they too high?'
p5077
aS'Itll be unfair to say that.'
p5078
aS'The telecom players bid according to the markets.'
p5079
aS'If one looks at the process, every player bid quite smartly.'
p5080
aS'They all had balance sheet and budget issues, beyond which they didnt want to spend.'
p5081
aS'Within that, they managed to get circles important for them.'
p5082
aS'The bids were more than the expectations, but to say they were very high will be unreal, because the 3G spectrum is valuable.'
p5083
aS'The spectrum will remain uncontested for the next 20 years.'
p5084
aS'For most operators, upgrading to 3G from 2G will be an incremental cost and wont be a substantial capex.'
p5085
aS'Plus, they will have other synergies coming in.'
p5086
aS'The Indian telecom industry is moving back to the mindset of high average revenue per user (Arpu).'
p5087
aS'Moreover, it wasnt just one company that was willing to pay that price.'
p5088
aS'Four rational players with running businesses were willing to spend that much.'
p5089
aS'And, they were some of the biggest operators and serious bidders, not mavericks.'
p5090
aS'With US and Europe economies not doing well, could we see more outbound M&As?'
p5091
aS'It remains to be seen if there are attractive valuations.'
p5092
aS'They become attractive when economic growth slows, but one has to consider that any increase in global risks may impact the banking system and availability of finance for acquisitions.'
p5093
aS'Some capital market investors have found it difficult to convince themselves that it was rational for Indian companies to make acquisitions overseas, while they were coming to India to buy the India growth story.'
p5094
aS'So, it may make sense only in some sectors.'
p5095
aS'One may see lot of outbound on the resources side  coal, oil and gas, because of economic uncertainty.'
p5096
aS'If prices of these commodities drop, or if there is a need for capital and companies start shedding assets, one may see Indian companies go out and buy.'
p5097
aS'Outlook for domestic consolidation?'
p5098
aS'One will see some of that.'
p5099
aS'Telecom will be one of the bigger sectors where one will see consolidation happening.'
p5100
aS'Apart from that, there arent many sectors with a strong theme for consolidation.'
p5101
aS'Media?'
p5102
aS'Maybe yes, but most companies are small.'
p5103
aS'The theme will stay in the information technology sector.'
p5104
aS'What are your growth plans over the next three years?'
p5105
aS'We plan to remain in the advisory business.'
p5106
aS'We expect to grow faster than the market.'

aS'We have 22 bankers across Mumbai and Delhi.'
p5108
aS'Aspirations are more qualitative than quantitative.'
p5109
aS'On hirings in the last cycle, we didnt let anybody go, and made a few more appointments recently.'
p5110
aS'Which sectors are private equity investors focusing on?'
p5111
aS'Most private equity investors are sector agnostic.'
p5112
aS'All of them are looking for opportunities in sectors that present scope for organic growth, and this may include most sectors in India.'
p5113
aS'We dont see particular sectoral trend or theme.'
p5114
aS'What is your outlook on exits?'
p5115
aS'Until 2007, a lot of exits used to focus on the capital market exits  block sales after a companys initial public offering.'
p5116
aS'Since 2008, a lot of exits have been made by strategic investors.'
p5117
aS'The trend will continue.'
p5118
aS'There is great interest from international strategic investors.'

aS'Entire 50 mt yearly output for its power projects here; looking for more mine buys\nIndias biggest coal importer, Adani Enterprises, has acquired an Australian coal asset of Linc Energy in a cash and royalty deal worth $2.7 billion (Rs 12,500 crore).'
p5120
aS'This would be the largest single investment by an Indian company in Australia and a second coal acquisition abroad for Adani.'

aS"Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board has approved the deal and the provisional Queensland government has given an indicative approval."

aS'The entire quantity will be imported into India.'
p5127
aS'We are using the integrated play of coal, mining and port, which is available within the group, Devang Desai, group chief financial officer, told Business Standard.'
p5128
aS'He said the company was looking to buy more coal assets in Indonesia and Australia.'
p5129
aS'The group is also planning to set up an import terminal at Mackay, which will enable the company to ship the coal to India.'
p5130
aS'"While multiple evacuation routes are available for mined coal, Adani (through Mundra Port and Special Economic Zone) has recently been awarded Preferred Proponent Status for the development of Dudgeon Point Terminal at Mackay, Queensland, which entitles Adani the right (subject to technical and commercial feasibility) to develop a coal terminal of 30-60 mtpa capacity," the company said in the statement.'
p5131
aS'The coal from Galilee would support the rapid expansion of sister firm Adani Power Ltd, which is developing power projects at Mundra, Dahej and Bhadreshwar in Gujarat, Tiroda and Kawai in Maharashtra and Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh.'
p5132
aS'The combined capacity of these projects is estimated to be 13,000 Mw.'
p5133
aS'"Adani Group aims to achieve 20,000 Mw power generation capacity by 2020, of which 13,000 Mw power projects are being implemented by the company.'
p5134
aS'There is a clear need for securing coal supply and the Australian coal asset will help us reach to the target," an executive said.'
p5135
aS'The group has tied up the entire quantity needed for 6,600 Mw power capacity through domestic linkages.'
p5136
aS'Some of its present requirement is also being met from its captive mine in Indonesia.'
p5137
aS'The additional imports will be used for its capacity addition plan in the power sector, besides trading.'
p5138
aS'We have a two-pronged play in the coal sector.'
p5139
aS'We have 50 per cent share in total coal imports into the country and we need coal for captive use.'

p5142
aS'According to Desai, about a 10th of their imports were from Australia.'

aS"Over 7,600 tonnes of wheat of 2008-09 year and 5,245 tonnes of wheat of crop year 2007-08 lying at PUNGRAIN's storage at Rampura Phul in Bathinda district, and about 5,867 tonnes of wheat of 2006-07 crop year kept at Chabal in Tarn Taran have been damaged."
p5335
aS'Besides, 5,215 tonnes of crop procured by PAFC have also got rotten.'
p5336
aS'Experts blame a number of factors, including storing crop in an unscientific way, snail-paced movement of foodgrain out of the state, acute shortage of covered space for storing crop, for the damage of wheat.'
p5337
aS'State-owned lifting agency Punjab State Grains Procurement Corporation (PUNGRAIN) has invited tenders for the disposal of 24,011 MT of damaged wheat which is now unfit for human consumption.'
p5338
aS'According to an official, the damaged wheat is mainly used in making cattle feed or fertiliser.'
p5339
aS'Notably, in September last year also, Punjab government decided to dispose 6,000 MT of damaged wheat through auction which also got rotten in "poorly maintained" storage capacities.'
p5340
aS'"The wheat, which will be disposed of through auction, has been damaged because of rains and also lying at open plinths at few places," a senior official of Punjab Food and Supplies Department said.'
p5341
aS'As there is a huge shortage of covered space for storing crop to save it from the vagaries of weather, wheat crop is mainly stored at open plinths (CAP) at wooden platform covered with tarpaulin in Punjab, which always face a threat of being damaged if not stored as per specifications, experts said.'
p5342
aS'Punjab, which is the food bowl of the country, has a total covered storage capacity of 96 lakh MT and 99 lakh MT capacity of CAP for central pool.'

p5350
aS'Similarly, prices of cotton yarn, medium and coarse count also declined.'
p5351
aS'However, traders say prices of cotton yarns have stabilised since the second week of July.'
p5352
aS'The prices had dipped on account of an increase in supply and lower demand from Europe.'
p5353
aS'As far as polyester yarns are concerned, POY prices were cut by Rs 2 a kg in the first week of July due to sluggish demand, said a source in a leading yarn producer company.'
p5354
aS'The decline in raw material cost, PTA (polyethylene terephthalate acid) and MEG (Monoethylene glycol), in the international market, also contributed to the fall in polyester yarn prices.'
p5355
aS'Polyester texturised yarn (PTY), prices of which had firmed up last month, is likely to be impacted by lower raw material costs and recent fall in crude oil prices.'
p5356
aS'There are possibilities of PTY prices coming down by Rs 1 a kg, said a source.'
p5357
aS'As against this, medium and coarse count cotton yarn saw a reduction of Rs 5-10 a kg from the increased level on low export demand and increase in production at Bhiwandi, one of the major yarn producing centers in India.'
p5358
aS'Labour and power problems at Bhiwandi had created a shortage of yarn in the market.'

p5396
aS'In fact, like any other investment instrument, returns from registered chit fund schemes vary between eight and 12 per cent per annum, while the interest rate for borrowing is one to three per cent per month.'

aS'So its obvious that agents who earn up to 25 per cent commission to bring in deposits are doing a good job of convincing people to aim for a pie in the sky.'

aS'Many people who use chits have no access to banks and other forms of finance, thus chits provide a good local solution that helps them pool savings and provide funding to businesses and individuals.'

aS'Our research also finds that people are smart at comparing the effective interest rates between chits, banks and money lenders and thus there is competition between some of these institutions, said Antoinette Schoar, professor of economics at MIT, USA.'

aS'Nayar laid stress for productive use of loan facilities and timely repayment of the same so that money is recycled which is a must for the growth of the economy and the nation.'
p5732
aS'On the occasion.'
p5733
aS'He asked to avail facility of free counselling available at the Financial Literacy and Credit Counselling cell opened by the Bank as Lead Bank at Mini Secretariat Bhatinda.'

aS'Gautam Thapar is chairman and CEO of the $4-billion Avantha Group, which includes the power transmission and distribution equipment major, Crompton Greaves (CG), and the paper heavyweight, BILT.'
p5736
aS'He spoke to Pallavi Aiyar at the port city of Zeebrugge in Belgium, where CG has been involved in the design, solutions and manufacture of equipment for one of Europes most ambitious offshore wind projects, the Belwind wind farm.'
p5737
aS'He speaks on overseas acquisitions, why China is not on Avanthas horizons and the continuing difficulties Indian companies face in making the leap from international to truly global entities.'
p5738
aS'Edited excerpts:\nAvantha has made a strong push in Europe, with several acquisitions for Crompton Greaves and Global Green.'
p5739
aS'Given the slowdown here, how do you foresee growth in the region?'
p5740
aS'Its not like there is no growth in Europe.'
p5741
aS'The slowdown is in certain sectors but in energy, particularly renewables, there is growth.'
p5742
aS'Its a good place to be when it comes to CG.'
p5743
aS'But in other sectors, its a difficult time for acquisitions in Europe.'
p5744
aS'In the period between 2003 and 2008, a lot of companies became spoilt and even today, they think the valuation their business got in that period is here to stay.'
p5745
aS'It isnt because the growth is not there any more.'
p5746
aS'There is a clear reluctance to adjust thinking to new realities in the region.'
p5747
aS'But is Europes crisis an opportunity for Avantha?'
p5748
aS'Yes, in some ways.'
p5749
aS'We have good relations with Indian banks, with major operations overseas, so financing is available to us and we are in a good position to look at opportunities.'
p5750
aS'But we are very conscientious and dont want to overpay either.'
p5751
aS'Theres enough growth within Avantha for us not to need to go out and buy that growth.'
p5752
aS'But, then, why have you been acquiring assets so aggressively in recent months?'
p5753
aS'Our focus outside India has always been on technology because in India, you are still not there when it comes to many industries as far as innovation, consortium working, etc are concerned.'
p5754
aS'So, for CG, going global has meant access to talent and knowledge where it is available, rather than having to create it in our own environment, which would be very difficult.'
p5755
aS'In India, there is in fact much more innovation in services than in manufacturing, with the exception of the auto sector.'
p5756
aS'Interestingly, in Europe, all major countries are beginning to talk about how industrial policies are needed even in economies where the GDP is very skewed towards services.'
p5757
aS'There is a realisation that a strategy for manufacturing is needed even in the UK, where it is only eight per cent of GDP.'
p5758
aS'The financial world is the most fickle thing.'
p5759
aS'Money is here today, gone tomorrow.'
p5760
aS'What lessons can India learn from Europes current predicament?'
p5761
aS'To retool its manufacturing economy.'
p5762
aS'Our legislations are still outdated, like the Factories Act and some of the labour laws.'
p5763
aS'There is very little support for research and innovation from the government.'
p5764
aS'A small country like Belgium is putting together a $500-million fund just for offshore wind energy; in India, we have nothing.'
p5765
aS'How have you managed the challenges that going global create for corporate culture and the work force?'
p5766
aS'Within Avantha, CG is a good international company but to become truly global, we have to move to the next step.'
p5767
aS'When you think globally, you think in a very different way to internationally.'
p5768
aS'In the latter, you still think in terms of specific markets and geographies but when you think globally, you think of things you can achieve or roll out worldwide.'
p5769
aS'But for that, the kind of resource and managerial capability required is totally different from that in a good international company.'
p5770
aS'Most Indian companies today are still at the cost-productivity stage and not able to manage the complexity and environment that truly global companies can.'
p5771
aS'What will it take for Avantha to make that leap to become a global group?'
p5772
aS'We have started to make the leap.'
p5773
aS'It starts with recruitment, training, and exposure.'
p5774
aS'But the transition is not easy because more than a way of working, there is a big cultural transformation that has to take place and in India at the moment, we just dont have the critical mass of young managers exposed to the world.'
p5775
aS'So, many of us are trying to find Indians who have worked for MNCs outside of India, to bring them into the system.'
p5776
aS'As an Indian firm, were there special challenges of acceptance when you bought European companies?'
p5777
aS'There is always tension.'
p5778
aS'If I come and buy you and youve been around for 40-50 years, the uncertainty and fear factor is huge.'
p5779
aS'People feel youve bought the company but you have not bought my mind, my loyalty.'
p5780
aS'So, you need to earn that right.'
p5781
aS'If it was GE that had bought Pauwels ( a Belgian power transformer manufacturer acquired by CG in 2006), it would be a very different reaction because it is already an established global name.'
p5782
aS'But when a CG comes in, we have to earn our spurs, so there is an extra mile or three we have to walk to get to the same place.'
p5783
aS'But if you do it right and start showing results, then the initial fears that these people have come here to buy us and move all the jobs to India disappears.'
p5784
aS'In fact, we have created new jobs in the locality.'
p5785
aS'So, after that hurdle is crossed, the coalescing is very quick.'
p5786
aS'How seriously are you looking at China as either a market or manufacturing base?'
p5787
aS'China is a difficult country because there is very little complementarily in the way we do business.'
p5788
aS'There is such a huge amount of state support there that its difficult to find an entry point.'
p5789
aS'If you want to supply equipment to the Chinese grid or power sector, despite the fact that the whole world is signed on to the International Electricity Association and we send all our equipment to be tested there, the Chinese dont accept it and you have to send your equipment to China for testing.'
p5790
aS"The testing alone costs '10 crore and your equipment is lying on their test floors for months on end."
p5791
aS'At the end of the day, you may not get approval because it does not meet Chinese standards.'
p5792
aS'So, why would we really want to go to China?'
p5793
aS'The market is not open to us, there is potential for IPR (intellectual property rights) theft and there are two clear sets of rules: one for Chinese and one for non-Chinese.'
p5794
aS'As far as manufacturing is concerned, why would we go to China?'
p5795
aS'India has very competitive manufacturing.'
p5796
aS'So, for the moment, China is not on our horizons.'
p5797
aS'So, what new markets are you looking to diversify into?'
p5798
aS'South America is where weve been supplying a lot of equipment power, to the grids in Chile and Peru.'
p5799
aS'Weve been looking for a beachhead there and we thought we had one three years ago.'
p5800
aS'But it didnt work out and we are now in discussions somewhere else.'
p5801
aS'What are your targets for Avanthas growth overall?'
p5802
aS'We are currently a $4-billion group.'
p5803
aS'We had targeted $10-billion by 2013 but 2008-09 was a bit of a setback for us, like everyone else.'
p5804
aS'We are now confident of making that target by 2015.'

p5823
aS'Buoyed by the spurt in demand for mass housing projects in the country, Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) had planned to develop housing projects for the low and middle income groups in 4-5 locations in and around the city.'
p5824
aS'The authority had lined up an investment of Rs 80-100 crore on developing 1,000 dwelling units which would be a mix 1-BHK (bedroom hall kitchen), 2-BHK and 3-BHK flats.'

p5826
aS'The total built-up area of the flats would range from 700-1,700 sq ft and the price of these flats would vary from Rs 7 lakh to Rs 25 lakh depending on the built-up area.'
p5827

aS'Should I invest in a mutual fund or SIP?'
p5833
aS'I want to either invest around Rs 1 lakh at a stretch or Rs 3,000 each month, in the case of an SIP for at least five years.'
p5834
aS'-Suresh Ahlawat\nAn SIP is just a method of investing in a mutual fund.'
p5835
aS'It is an abbreviation for Systematic Investment Plan (SIP).'
p5836
aS'That means you invest fixed amounts at pre-determined periods in a fund.'
p5837
aS'Depending on the NAV on the date of your purchase, you will get units assigned to you.'
p5838
aS'The three types available are: Quarterly SIP (invest in units once in three months), monthly SIP (every month) and daily SIP (every day).'
p5839
aS'We do not advise you to invest your money at one go.'
p5840
aS'Invest in a fund regularly over years.'
p5841
aS'This way, market timing does not play a role in your investments.'
p5842
aS'You sound like a first-time investor.'
p5843
aS'If so, we suggest you opt for two balanced funds, with monthly SIPs of Rs 1,500 in each.'
p5844
aS'Later, when you are building a portfolio, you can go in for a pure equity scheme.'
p5845
aS'Consider DSPBR Balanced, Canara Robeco Balanced or HDFC Prudence.'
p5846
aS'What happens to the dividend mutual funds receive from companies in which they have invested?'
p5847
aS'Is it added to the funds net asset value (NAV)?'
p5848
aS'-Nitin Bindal\nYes, if stocks in a portfolio are the beneficiaries of bonus shares or dividends, it is ploughed back into the portfolio and hence, ultimately, reflected in the funds NAV.'
p5849
aS'I plan to do a systematic investment plan (SIP) in Magnum Contra, DSPBR Equity, HDFC Top 200, Fidelity India Growth and Quantum Equity.'
p5850
aS'Your views?'
p5851
aS'-Meera Nambudiri\nYour fund selection is good.'
p5852
aS'If we take an overall view of this portfolio, your equity allocation is 94 per cent, the balance being in debt and cash.'
p5853
aS'Though the top 10 stocks are all large-caps, the mid- and small-cap allocation is around 33 per cent.'
p5854
aS'We have two suggestions here.'
p5855
aS'The first being that you replace a fund that falls in the large- & mid-cap category with a large-cap fund.'
p5856
aS'Consider Franklin India Bluechip or IDFC Imperial Equity Plan A.'
p5857
aS'Second, you can do with just four funds.'
p5858
aS'If that is alright, you can drop Magnum Contra.'
p5859
aS'I am a beginner with mutual funds.'
p5860
aS'I would like to know the difference between a regular equity MF and a tax-saving fund.'
p5861
aS'Do all MFs offer the tax benefit under Section 80C?'
p5862
aS'Can I withdraw my money at any time from a MF?'
p5863
aS'I would also like to know the difference between an equity and debt fund.'
p5864
aS'-Raghu\nA regular equity fund and a tax-saving fund have one factor in common.'
p5865
aS'They both invest in stocks across sectors.'
p5866
aS'In other words, both are equity diversified funds.'
p5867
aS'They may have a market-cap tilt; for instance, some funds may invest more in large-cap stocks, others in mid-caps, while still others may have a multi-cap tilt.'
p5868
aS'The difference is that a tax saving fund, called equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS), offers the benefit under Section 80C.'
p5869
aS'No other category does.'
p5870
aS'If the fund is open-ended, you can sell your units any time.'
p5871
aS'If it is an ELSS, then your money is blocked for three years.'
p5872
aS'If the fund is closed-end, then for the determined tenure, you cannot buy any units of the fund.'
p5873
aS'Technically, you cannot even sell during the fund tenure.'
p5874
aS'However, many give an option to exit after paying an exit load.'
p5875
aS'Just like an equity fund invests in stocks listed on an exchange, a debt fund will invest in fixed return instruments or debt instruments that are traded in the debt market.'
p5876
aS'State Bank of India (SBI) today said the banking sector is facing pressure on assets due to a sharp increase in defaults on credit card and personal loan payments.'
p5877
aS'"In the last two years, there has been a sharp deterioration in the asset quality (of lenders) because of stress in products like credit cards and personal loans, which is a challenge as we go forward," SBI Chairman O P Bhatt said at a banking conference organised by industry body Ficci and the Indian Banks Association.'
p5878
aS'The number of credit cards in circulation have, however, gone down by 17 per cent to 1.89 crore as on June 30, as against 2.28 crore in the same period last fiscal.'

aS'They accounted for about Rs 17,000 crore of transactions during the first quarter of the current fiscal, according to the RBI data.'
p5880
aS'Personal loans, which is another area of concern for the banking sector, are those funds which are provided by the banks, but are not tied to purchase of any specific good.'
p5881
aS'Banks had been aggressively selling personal loans as they fetch higher returns in term of interest rates.'
p5882
aS'Bhatt further said that losses accruing out of "alleged mis-selling of derivatives", or the selling of inappropriate products, also needed to be checked.'
p5883
aS'Referring to liquidity situation, Bhatt said there has been a wide fluctuation in the availability of funds with the banking system in the recent past.'
p5884
aS'Describing the liquidity situation like a "yo-yo", he said fund management has become a challenge for the banking system.'
p5885
aS'Bhatt, who is also the Chairman of the IBA, said he saw a huge potential for growth across sectors, fuelled by aspirational youth, in the days ahead.'
p5886

aS'In August, nearly three months after the Environment Ministry withdrew the initial nod, it had restored the clearance granted to Jindal Power for its Chhattisgarh project.'
p5957
aS'After reviewing the case and details submitted by the project proponent (Jindal Power), the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) under the Environment Ministry had recommended that the project may be appraised by following the original Terms of Reference (ToR).'

aS'In June, the Ministry had revoked the initial clearance or TORs given to Jindal Power, last year, citing the violation of certain green norms.'
p5959
aS'It had withdrawn the ToR saying that the company cannot construct the power plant in the estimated 62 hectares of land.'

aS'The Ministry, which called the proposed project as "premature", had also said that the firm has changed the location of the proposed plant.'

aS'Combining fundamental and technical analysis is a useful method for fair-value calculations.'
p5971
aS'The price-to-earning (PE) ratio is the most popular fundamental ratio.'
p5972
aS'There are interesting ways to dissect it, using technical analysis, to develop new insights.'
p5973
aS'Fundamental analysts relate PE to earnings growth rates with the PEG ratio, and compare with peer company PEs, etc.'
p5974
aS'A fundamental analyst pegs a PE as high, low, or fair-value, depending on EPS projections.'
p5975
aS'Fair-value is a subjective calculation, based on earnings expectations and interest rates (the benchmark of risk-free returns).'
p5976
aS'The theory is that PE will correct from the high or low end to fair-value.'
p5977
aS'PE is a time-series that changes with price fluctuations.'
p5978
aS'Standard technical indicators are designed for time-series analysis.'
p5979
aS'From a technicians point of view, some properties of PE are obvious.'
p5980
aS'In technical terms, PE is a momentum oscillator, that fluctuates between minimum and maximum values.'
p5981
aS'It can be normalised like other oscillators.'
p5982
aS'The PE has a long-term average and a tendency to stay close to that average.'
p5983
aS'The PE average is not fair-value, according to the fundamental definition.'
p5984
aS'But the average is likely to be close to historical fair-value in a reasonably efficient market.'
p5985
aS'Combining technicals with fundamentals offers a useful method of checking fair-value calculations.'
p5986
aS'A big divergence between historical average and fair-value is in itself, interesting.'
p5987
aS'It implies something has changed about the business, or the fair-value calculation has a hole.'
p5988
aS'When such divergence exists, the data suggests PE is likely to trend closer to the historical average, rather than current fair-value.'
p5989
aS'The nearly-normal PE distribution means predictability.'
p5990
aS'Around 65-70 per cent of the time, the PE will stay within one standard deviation of average.'
p5991
aS'It strays beyond two standard deviations only around 5-7 per cent of the time for most stocks.'
p5992
aS'Beyond two standard deviations can be defined as over-bought (high PE) and oversold (low PE) zones.'
p5993
aS'Seen this way, PE is a technical indicator, ideally used over a long time-frame.'
p5994
aS'It differs in this respect from classic technical indicators that can be used in any timeframe.'
p5995
aS'Technical data confirms that if a stock, or a diversified portfolio (like the Nifty) is bought below average PE, (regardless of current fair-value) the returns are higher than normal.'
p5996
aS'A fundamental investor can therefore, go overweight whenever PE is below average with some confidence, rather than relying on subjective fair-value calculations.'
p5997
aS'Conversely if the PE is above average, even if fair-value suggests that it is low, the investor should be very cautious.'
p5998
aS'Technical analysis also tells us how sensitive specific stocks are to results .'
p5999
aS'It can help to identify periods in every quarter when results are announced and earnings change.'
p6000
aS'If theres a sharp EPS change, or surprising projections, does the PE remain stable due to corresponding sharp price changes?'
p6001
aS'Obviously this varies with individual stocks.'
p6002
aS"But it's data that can be correlated to holding patterns (promoter holdings, institutional interest, retail & operators)."
p6003
aS'Understanding this behaviour can again help with buy-sell tactics and offers insights into volatility.'
p6004
aS'Another interesting application is targeting turnarounds.'
p6005
aS'Typically in a highly cyclical industry, PE may go from negative (when earnings are in the red) to a large positive PE (as earnings edge into the black).'
p6006
aS'Then the PE reduces even while price rises through a period when EPS growth is strong enough to outrun price.'
p6007
aS'Technical analysis can isolate such patterns and offer pointers about long-term price targets.'
p6008
aS'A little research suggests those targets are likely to be more accurate than the purely fundamental fair-value approach because PEs swing a lot in turnarounds.'
p6009
aS'Another possible insight comes from turning PE upside-down and comparing to interest rate movements.'
p6010
aS'Comparing the earnings-to-price-yield (EY) to risk-free returns is of course, standard for fundamental analysts.'
p6011
aS'We know stock prices trend up when EY is higher than the interest rate and vice-versa, stock prices trend down if the EY is lower.'
p6012
aS'However, the relationship can be more efficiently mapped using technical analysis.'
p6013
aS'Technicians can for example, back-test and correlate to discover which interest rate has the highest inverse correlation to price movements.'
p6014
aS'Another possibility is to study the spread or differential between interest rates and EY to judge when the stock price is likely to correct and in which direction.'
p6015
aS'That spread is also an oscillator  the difference never gets too large in either direction.'
p6016
aS'These are all unconventional ways to use PE.'
p6017
aS'They will shock purists in both technical and fundamental camps.'
p6018
aS'A vast amount of number-crunching would be needed to refine the processes.'
p6019
aS'But, they could produce interesting ways to beat the street.'

p6332
aS'MPFI then took up the task of defining interoperability standards so that payment can be made across banks and that too using only the mobile phone number.'
p6333
aS"It came up with the concept of MMID, which serves three purposes: MMID provides the parity bits so that a transaction is rejected in case a customer enters the payee's mobile number wrongly; in case a customer has multiple bank accounts mapped to her phone, the MMID would be different for each of these accounts; finally , the MMID helps in identifying the destination bank when a transaction is carried out."

p6459
aS'At present 100 per cent FDI is allowed in the hotel and tourism sector through the automatic route.'
p6460
aS'The new riders suggested by RBI include a lock-in period for the original investment, which means foreign investors cannot sell and walk out of the Indian company whenever they choose.'

aS'SUGGESTIONS\n# Lock-in period for original investment, which means foreign investors cannot sell and walk out of the Indian company whenever they choose\n# A monitoring mechanism to check FDI violations\n# A quarterly/annual reporting on receipt and usage of foreign inward remittance\n# Granting permission/licence to run hotel under which construction of hotel should be completed within stimulated period\n# Clauses under which investor/investee company would not be allowed to sell undeveloped plots\n# Put onus of checking FDI violations on administrative ministry or states concerned\nThe central bank has stated that, as regards FDI in hotels and tourism, once the inward remittance received by the Indian company has been taken on record, there is no mechanism  neither under the FDI policy nor under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema)  to monitor the end use as such investments are spread across the country.'
p6469
aS'RBI believes that non-residents set up companies for building hotels or tourism-related infrastructure and divert the money coming as FDI to buy immovable property in India, which is not allowed.'
p6470
aS'This leads to macroeconomic concerns and creates an asset bubble in real estate by pushing prices up artificially.'
p6471
aS'This, according to the central bank, can be detrimental to the domestic economy.'
p6472
aS'It has called for post-investment monitoring of FDI, or suitable tweaking of the policy, as reporting under Fema does not capture intentional violations.'
p6473
aS'The central bank adds that a violation of FEMA (which it is in this case) can be dealt with by compounding (by the RBI as well as the Department of Economic Affairs), since RBI does not monitor the end use and only looks at cases which have been bought to its notice.'
p6474
aS'RBI points out that in order to curtail arbitrage the government should put the onus of checking FDI violations in hotels and tourism on the administrative ministry or the states concerned, as has been done in certain other sectors.'

aS'Webel floated requests for proposals (RFP) last year, but found no takers for the project.'
p6570
aS'Two companies, Mahindra Lifespace and Paharpur Cooling Towers, that had initially evinced interest in the project and had tendered expression of interests, backed out, which left the project floundering.'
p6571
aS'They cited problems with infrastructure at Kalyani-the expressway is largely incomplete and not fit for commuters.'
p6572
aS'Private industry is not sure if it will get participants, given that Kalyani is too far from the airport, said Shyamal Dasgupta, executive director, Webel.'
p6573
aS'The project was supposed to be developed through public-private partnership (PPP) model.'
p6574
aS'Webel had earlier appointed Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd as the project consultant.'
p6575
aS'The Rs 1,000-crore project was supposed to come up on about 100 acres at Kalyani, about 50 km from Kolkata.'
p6576
aS'Initially slated to be a special economic zone (SEZ), the project was later converted to focus on an integrated IT township so that formalities associated with an SEZ could be sidestepped.'
p6577
aS'Officials at Webel are hopeful though.'

aS'We have put the project on hold and intend to come up with a fresh round of requests for proposals soon, said Dasgupta.'
p6579
aS'Webel has not yet decided when these fresh proposals would be asked for.'
p6580
aS'Interestingly, the fact that the project has now been indefinitely stalled, has left Webel in the lurch as land acquisition for the project has been completed.'
p6581
aS'This means that Webel owes the land department Rs 53 crore.'
p6582
aS'Dasgupta, however, insisted that a waning interest at Kalyani was not necessarily reflective of waning industry interest in the Bengal IT industry as a whole.'

aS'There is robust demand for IT parks that are being developed elsewhere, including impending projects in tier-II and tier-III cities like Haldia, Durgapur and Silliguri.'

aS'Following this, Enam will become an Axis Bank subsidiary, headed by Enam Director Manish Chokani.'
p6598
aS'As part of the deal announced today, Enam Securities will demerge its investment banking, institutional & retail equities and related businesses such as distribution of financial products and non-banking financial company to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Axis Bank.'
p6599
aS'The bank will also demerge its investment banking unit into the subsidiary.'
p6600
aS'Enam shareholders will receive 5.7 shares of Axis Bank for every one share held in Enam, totalling about 3.3 per cent equity stake on the enlarged capital of Axis Bank.'
p6601
aS'Macquarie and Anil Singhvi acted as the advisors to the deal.'
p6602
aS'Enam reported around Rs90 crore profits in FY10 and about Rs75 crore in the first half of the current financial year.'
p6603
aS'Taking an average of last years profits and annualised earnings for the current year, its annual profits work out to around Rs120 crore.'
p6604
aS'Based on these numbers, the deal values Enam at around 17-18 times (including net current assets) forward multiple, which, according to analysts, is in line with the current market scenario.'
p6605
aS'Analysts said the price looks fair, given that various broking outfits such as IIFL, Motilal Oswal Securities and Emkay are trading at a PE of over 20 times based on trailing 12-month earnings.'
p6606
aS'The acquisition price looks even better if one were to exclude the net current assets of about Rs300 crore, which is part of the deal.'
p6607
aS'The value of the business being transferred to Axis Bank works out to about Rs1,750 crore.'
p6608
aS'This translates into a PE of 14.6 and compares well with the valuations of broader markets as well, analysts said.'
p6609
aS'Valuations apart, the deal offers good synergies.'
p6610
aS'We believe that there are significant synergies, negligible overlaps and a strong cultural fit between the two organisations, said Shikha Sharma, MD & CEO, Axis Bank.'

aS'We have a strong corporate banking and debt franchise, while Enams strength is ECM (equity capital market), she added.'
p6612

aS'In 2005, Hemendra Kothari exited DSP Merrill Lynch by selling his majority stake to the foreign partner.'

p6624
aS'The scheme will also require approvals from the high courts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.'
p6625
aS'Enam will be left with two main verticals: mutual fund and portfolio management services.'

p6627
aS'Enam and its founders cannot compete in any of the areas where business has been transferred to Axis Bank, said Enam Chairman Vallabh Bhanshali while addressing the media.'
p6628
aS'Around 400 Enam employees will move to Axis Bank as part of the deal.'
p6629
aS'The acquisition is expected to provide a strong fillip to Axis Banks share in capital market transactions, as Enam is one of the leading investment banks and has been part of most large equity offerings, including Coal India.'
p6630
aS'The agreement with Axis comes more than three years after reports first suggested that Enam is planning to sell a sizeable stake.'

aS'Corporation Bank first to blink, to withdraw scheme from Dec 1.'
p6639
aS'Even as Corporation Bank has decided to be the first one to withdraw teaser loan schemes, others led by the State Bank of India (SBI) have asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to define teaser loans.'
p6640
aS'Stung by the public criticism of teaser rates, SBI Chairman O P Bhatt told RBI officials in a post-monetary policy meeting on Friday that only eligible persons are given these loans and the norms are not diluted while extending such loans.'
p6641
aS'Moreover, he said, the teaser rate concept of the advanced economies could not be equated with what SBI was offering.'
p6642
aS'Investopedia describes teaser loans as an aspect of subprime lending, as they are usually offered to low-income home buyers.'
p6643
aS'Unfortunately, when these borrowers try to refinance the loan before the rate increases, most will not qualify for standard mortgages.'
p6644
aS'This leaves borrowers with increased monthly payments, which many cannot afford.'
p6645
aS'This method of loaning is considered risky, as the default rates are high.'
p6646
aS'However, SBI said that was not true in the Indian context.'
p6647
aS'The home loan scheme of SBI charges eight per cent interest for the first year, nine per cent for the second and third year.'
p6648
aS'From the fourth year, the loan rate gets linked to the banks base rate.'
p6649
aS'SBI wants the central bank to define what can qualify as a teaser loan, a person who attended the meeting said.'
p6650
aS'Bhatt had earlier expressed his displeasure over RBI terming a teaser rate as a dual rate scheme and said nobody was teasing anyone.'
p6651
aS'The central bank had called a meeting of select bank chiefs to take their views regarding the policy announcements made during the second quarter review of the annual monetary policy earlier this month.'
p6652
aS'RBI had increased the standard asset provisioning for dual rate loan schemes five times to two per cent  a move seen as a clampdown on teaser loan products.'
p6653
aS'SBI, which pioneered the teaser loan concept in the country, also said higher provisioning would mean that a bank would have to set aside a higher amount from its profits, which in turn would affect the bottom line adversely.'
p6654
aS'Punjab National Bank is another bank which has teaser loan products.'
p6655
aS'Bankers sought clarity from the regulator whether two per cent provisioning was required to be done during the entire tenure of the loan or till the time fixed rates were offered.'
p6656
aS'Without the clarity, bankers said it was difficult to estimate the amount of provisioning.'
p6657
aS'Interestingly, RBI is yet to issue a circular effecting the increase in the provisioning requirement for teaser loans, even after nearly a month from the announcement.'
p6658
aS'Apart from Bhatt, ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar and HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri attended the meeting.'
p6659
aS'The central bank was represented by deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath along with executive directors and chief general managers.'
p6660
aS'SBI launched the teaser home loan scheme in February 2009 when the country was fighting the trickle-down effect of the global financial crisis.'
p6661
aS'The scheme, which was initially launched for a few months, became hugely popular and as a result SBI went on to extend the scheme.'
p6662
aS'From SBIs point of view, the loan product was introduced to boost demand during the downturn.'
p6663
aS'However, RBI feels floating rate loans for a very long tenure pose a risk because it is not possible to predict interest for a very long period.'
p6664
aS'Corporation Bank has decided to withdraw it prematurely from November 30.'
p6665
aS'The scheme, which was launched in October, was scheduled to be offered till December 31.'

p7202
aS'Endodontists perform a variety of procedures including root canal therapy, Endodontic retreatment, surgery, treating cracked teeth, and treating dental trauma.'

aS'Till recently, the easiest way to transfer money was through Internet or phone banking.'
p7207
aS'The entire process took another step forward last weeknow you can transfer money through your cellphone.'
p7208
aS'The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has launched an inter-bank mobile payment service (IMPS), which will enable savings account holders to transfer money to another account within the country using their cellphone.'
p7209
aS'Illustration: Jayachandran/Mint\nIs it available to all?'
p7210
aS'To avail the facility, it is mandatory that the bank in which you hold an account and the one in which the beneficiary has an account are linked to the IMPS.'
p7211
aS'Currently, seven banks have gone live with the system State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd, Union Bank of India, Bank of India, HDFC Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd.'
p7212
aS'Seven more are in the process of going live and several others are in the preliminary phase.'
p7213
aS'Just like you can use your debit card in the ATM machine of almost any bank now, one will eventually be able to transfer money to account holder of most banks, as more and more banks join the network, says Suresh Sethi, group president (transaction banking), Yes Bank.'
p7214
aS'What you need\nThe first step is to get yours as well as the beneficiarys cellphone number registered with the respective banks.'
p7215
aS'As with any financial transaction, the sending side needs to be more secure than the recipient.'
p7216
aS'The sender, thus, needs to register for mobile banking and acquire his mobile personal identification number (MPIN) as well as MMID (mobile money identity) number.'
p7217
aS'The first four digits of an MMID is the banks identification code; each account has a unique MMID and cellphone number combination.'
p7218
aS'So, while each cellphone number can be linked to multiple bank accounts, for each account you will have a unique MMID.'
p7219
aS'The recipient, however, need not be a mobile banking customer; linking his mobile number to his bank account and getting an MMID is enough to enable the number to receive money through a cellphone.'
p7220
aS'Modes of transfer\nThere are two ways to do itby downloading an application on your cellphone or by simply sending an SMS.'
p7221
aS'Download version: To download the application, you would require a GPRS or a Java-enabled cellphone.'
p7222
aS'While some banks will have this application on their website, in others, you may need to visit the branch or an authorized cellphone dealer and get it downloaded on your phone.'
p7223
aS'It would depend on the bank.'
p7224
aS'Since transactions done though an application are encrypted, they are considered safe.'
p7225
aS'You can transfer up to Rs 50,000 per day per person through the download version, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.'
p7226
aS'You may transfer money to as many people as you want, but the total amount cannot exceed Rs 50,000.'
p7227
aS'This version is available with all banks registered with NPCI.'
p7228
aS'SMS version: Sending money through an SMS is relatively simple, but may not be safest mode since transactions done though an SMS are not encrypted and hence can be read by anyone.'
p7229
aS'Therefore, RBI has set an upper limit of Rs 1,000 per person per day on money transfers through an SMS.'
p7230
aS'As of now, only two banks Union Bank of India and Bank of Indiawill allow money transfers through SMS, according to NPCI.'
p7231
aS'Each bank will have its own security criteria in terms of SMS and MPIN verification.'
p7232
aS'How to transfer\nYou will just need the recipients MMID and cellphone number.'
p7233
aS'You wont need his name, bank account number, bank address or any other details.'
p7234
aS'Once you initiate the transaction, your bank will verify your MMID and MPIN and check if you have sufficient balance in your account to complete the transaction.'
p7235
aS'You will then get an SMS alert from your bank, stating that the amount has been debited from your account.'
p7236
aS'Your bank will then route the funds to the recipients bank through a clearing house.'
p7237
aS'The recipients bank will verify his MMID and cellphone number and credit the amount to his account.'
p7238
aS'Since we are looking at a unique 17-digit combination, the chances of money being credited to a wrong account due to an error while typing out the MMID or cellphone number are minimal, says M. Balakrishnan, chief operating officer, NPCI.'
p7239
aS'You will then get a second SMS informing you that the transaction has been completed.'
p7240
aS'The recipient, too, will get an SMS stating the amount has been credited to his account.'
p7241
aS'All this happens real time.'
p7242
aS'So the transaction gets completed in a few seconds or at the maximum, a few minutes, in case the messages dont go through on time.'
p7243
aS'We have seen that so far the transactions have all gone through in a few seconds as promised, but sometimes the SMS is not delivered on time.'
p7244
aS'Besides, IMPS transactions can be processed 24x7, says Balakrishnan.'
p7245
aS'If the transaction is not processed for any reason, the money is credited back to the senders account.'
p7246
aS'What it costs\nAccording to an RBI mandate, all banks will offer IMPS facility free of cost till 31 March 2011.'
p7247
aS'Today depending on various factors, remittances and money transfers attract a wide range of charges.'
p7248
aS'After 31 March, banks could levy charges, but this model is still in a nascent stage and, hence, it is too early to say anything, says Sethi.'
p7249
aS'The road ahead\nThe launch is in line with the objective of financial inclusion.'
p7250
aS'At the inauguration ceremony on 22 November, RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath acknowledged the success of mobile penetration in India, saying: The mobile phone offers a greater opportunity for effective delivery of financial services and furthering the cause of financial inclusion in a significant way.'
p7251
aS'India has a huge migrant populationthis system will make it convenient for them to remit money to their families.'
p7252
aS'Mobile to mobile transfers will ensure that they dont have to travel a distance to reach a bank branch or an ATM.'
p7253
aS'In fact, if his bank provides the facility, the remitted money can also be converted and saved on the mobile e-wallet as digital money, says Sethi.'

p7733
aS'The governor said the incremental credit-deposit (C/D) ratio of the banking sector was 102 per cent at the end of December 2010, up from 58 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.'
p7734
aS'Incremental C/D ratio indicates how much a bank has lent for every additional rupee it has received as deposit.'
p7735
aS'Ideally, banks cannot lend, for example, more than Rs 70 for every Rs 100 they mobilised as deposits, because they need to set aside Rs 30 in the form of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).'

aS'Banks borrow in the overnight market, that is, call money market and from the liquidity adjustment facility of RBI, and lend it.'
p7739

p7740
aS'(Click here for graph)\nApart from deposits, banks can also use their borrowed funds for lending.'

aS'Deposits constituted around 78 per cent of the total liabilities of banks in 2009-10, while borrowing formed only 8.7 per cent of the total.'
p7743
aS'If the trend continues, it can lead to widening of the asset-liability gap, which is the last thing a regulator wants.'
p7744
aS'The incremental credit-deposit ratio has been above 100 per cent for the system and, therefore, RBI has rightly said banks should manage their resources portfolio to sustain credit deployment.'
p7745
aS'Otherwise, it could lead to a huge mismatch between resources and credit, said Bank of Baroda Chairman and Managing Director M D Mallya.'
p7746
aS'The situation is grave because most banks, especially the bigger ones, have high incremental C/D ratio.'
p7747
aS'Everybody is at the optimum position and the ability to provide cash support to each other when liquidity dries up is limited.'
p7748
aS'This may lead to a systemic problem, said an executive of a public sector bank.'
p7749
aS'High incremental credit-deposit ratio was mainly on account of low deposit growth, compared to credit growth.'
p7750
aS'Deposit mobilisation was sluggish on account of very low return offered on term deposits that prevailed during most part of the year, as banks started raising deposit rates only after October.'
p7751
aS'Credit growth was over 23 per cent in the last one year and deposit growth around 16 per cent.'
p7752
aS'At the beginning of the financial year, RBI had projected credit and deposit growth at 20 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively.'

aS'Analysts said banks would cut down credit expansion during the fourth quarter.'

aS'Mallya suggests there is a need to focus more on resources and ensure it matches deployment.'
p7759
aS'Raising interest rates is not the only option.'

p7829
aS'The HC also held that the CERC cannot act and frame regulations in the futures contract for electricity "unless the Parliament makes a fresh enactment in this behalf".'
p7830
aS'An HC bench of Justices P B Majmudar and Anoop Mohta declared that provisions under the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Power Market) Regulations, 2010 dealing with futures in electricity will no longer be operative.'
p7831
aS'The HC directions came while it was deciding the controversy between two regulators-FMC and CERC-on who controls futures in electricity.'
p7832
aS'The HC said that the Electricity Act of 2003 is a special law which deals with various aspects of electricity, including price fixation, market and consumer interest.'
p7833
aS'The CERC, which functions under the Electricicty Act, is empowered to fix rates and govern trade in electricity, The HC, however, held that "CERC has no jurisdiction to frame any Regulations in connection with futures contract as another law-the Forward Contract (regulaton ) Act, 1952-specifically deals with that."'
p7834
aS'"Looking to the special nature of electricity as commodity and the need to regulate its price, in our view, the futures contract in electricity cannot be exclusively dealt with by FMC," said the HC.'
p7835
aS'But it added, "With a view to harmonise provisions of Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 and the Electricity Act, 2003, in our view, the futures contract no doubt is within the domain of FMC" and at the same time, CERC ought not to be denied jurisdiction since physical delivery of electricity and electricity derivative products form part of the electricity market structure under the Electricity Act.'
p7836
aS'The court was faced with two petitions filed by FMC and Multi Commodity Exchange in India (MCX) challenging the January 2010 CERC regulations which placed sole jurisdiction in approving futures trading in electricity with itself.'
p7837
aS'The regulations were "discriminatory, mala fide and arbitrary", said FMC counsel Janka Dwarkadas.'
p7838
aS'But CERC counsel Aspi Chinoy said that since both the laws were special enactments, the later one, which exclusively deals with electricity, must prevail.'
p7839
aS"Meanwhile, MCX, which in 2009 was given approval by FMC to launch futres trading in electricty through its online trading terminal, questioned CERC's jurisdiction to be the final auhority."

aS'Under the law on forward contracts, 103 commodites are covered, including electricity.'

aS'Indonesia may be looking to ban the exports of low-grade thermal coal by 2014, a move, which if undertaken, could have an impact on the domestic power sector that is dependent on the Southeast Asian country to bridge the coal supply shortfall in India.'
p7910
aS'"There are domestic market obligations, as we need coal for our own power producers.'
p7911
aS'From 2014 onwards, we will only export value-added coal of more than 5,600 kilocalories (kcal)," Djunaedi, deputy director of oil, gas and mine products at Indonesias Ministry of Trade, said on the sidelines of the ninth Annual Coal Markets Conference.'
p7912
aS'As the worlds largest thermal coal exporter, Indonesia has often found it difficult to procure enough supplies for domestic consumption.'
p7913
aS'Earlier this year, it implemented a series of measures to ensure that a portion of production was allocated to local industry.'
p7914
aS'However, the proposed ban on exports of coal under the 5,600-kcal mark stands to change the dynamics of the global thermal coal market, which has seen spiraling demand from Asian economies such as China and India.'
p7915
aS'The latter, for instance, is currently the worlds fastest-growing coal importer.'
p7916
aS'"Such a ban will have a substantial impact on the thermal coal market, as large amounts of low-quality coal from Indonesia are exported to India and China," said Mark Pervan, global head of commodity research at ANZ.'
p7917
aS'Low-quality coal, of between 4,800 and 5,800 kcal, constitutes a significant portion of exports out of Indonesia and, considering the country accounts for about 30 per cent of the global thermal coal supply, an export ban could reduce worldwide supplies by at least 10 per cent, Pervan added.'
p7918
aS'But Indonesias local mining industry is pushing hard to stop the move.'
p7919
aS'"We are in discussions with the government and are trying to postpone the ban.'
p7920
aS'If this measure is implemented, it will hit 60 per cent of our exports and we dont have the technology to undertake value-addition.'
p7921
aS'The government must give us the technology if this is what it wants," said Bob Kamandanu, chairman of the Indonesian Coal Producers Association.'
p7922
aS'India Impact \n\r\nIndia is already among the largest buyers of coal from Indonesia, and is expected to maintain this position considering the growth in domestic demand and stagnating production of major miners such as Coal India.'
p7923
aS'Earlier this month, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said India might have to import 142 million tonnes (mt) of the fuel in the next financial year, up from the earlier estimates of 104 mt.'
p7924
aS'"There will be an overall impact on the Indian power sector, as currently about 60 per cent of the total thermal coal imports are coming from Indonesia.'
p7925
aS'If the ban comes in, it could also affect domestic coal prices, apart from influencing global thermal coal prices," said Rupesh Sankhe, an analyst at Angel Broking.'
p7926
aS'Moreover, Indian firms have considerable interests in Indonesias coal sector.'
p7927
aS'Tata Power holds a 30 per cent stake in two of the countrys largest coal mines and the Adani Group, Indias biggest coal importer, last year committed $1.6 billion to build mining-related infrastructure in that country.'
p7928
aS'"It is a draft law at present, and there will be consultations with interested parties before finalisation," a spokesperson for the Adani Group said, adding that the group was already evaluating the possibility of setting up a power plant in Indonesia that would run on locally-mined coal.'
p7929
aS'====================================================\nQ&A: Bob Kamandanu, Chairman, Indonesian Coal Mining Association \n\r\nYou should come to Indonesia to do proper mining, not short-term profit-taking\nThe next big thing will be India coming into Indonesia for energy needs \n\r\nAlthough over 40 Indian companies are currently mining or exploring coal blocks in Indonesia, domestic interest in the Southeast Asian nations coal assets continue to remain strong.'
p7930
aS'There have been big-ticket buys, such as Tata Powers purchase of a substantial stake in two of Indonesias largest coal mines, along with proposed infrastructure investments, including the Adani Groups $1.65 billion for rail, port and power projects.'
p7931
aS'But other players, including state-run Coal India and the RPG Group flagship CESC, in spite of scouting, have been unable to secure assets.'
p7932
aS'Indonesian Coal Mining Association chairman Bob Kamandanu, in an interview on the sidelines of the Annual Coal Markets conference, tells Devjyot Ghoshal that Indian firms should look to buy big, and that the countrys mining sector faces some of the same challenges that domestic miners deal with in the subcontinent.'
p7933
aS'There has been a lot of Indian interest in Indonesias mining sector in recent times.'
p7934
aS'How important is this for the sector?'
p7935
aS'Of course, the interest is a good for us.'
p7936
aS'But one must remember, whether (they are companies) from India or China, coal mining in Indonesia is in remote areas and is open-cast.'
p7937
aS'So, that means, we are going to cut trees, open up virgin forests.'
p7938
aS'One must understand that doing mining (in Indonesia) is not cheap.'
p7939
aS'It is expensive and it has to be a sizable operation so that you can have money set aside for taking care of environment and community development since lots of poor people surround these areas.'
p7940
aS'If we have big operations, with enough money set aside to do all these activities, then we can follow good mining practices.'
p7941
aS'You should come to Indonesia to do proper mining, and not short-term profit taking.'
p7942
aS'Is short-term profit taking a concern for your mining industry?'
p7943
aS'A lot of people are now doing this.'
p7944
aS'They are not miners.'
p7945
aS'They come into Indonesia, make money and leave.'
p7946
aS'So, what we want to see are the real mining companies, possibly from the government of India or owners of intellectual property rights who have the funds and knowhow.'
p7947
aS'We have to focus on this, and that people acquire something sizeable.'
p7948
aS'Is environment emerging as an area of concern for Indonesias coal mining sector?'
p7949
aS'Yes.'
p7950
aS'Not just environment, but forestry.'
p7951
aS'As I mentioned earlier, a lot of forests are virgin forests.'
p7952
aS'We have to look at the purpose of the forests (according to Indonesian government classifications).'
p7953
aS'Are these productive forests or protected forests or other purposes?'
p7954
aS'If it is other purposes, then we can get it from the local government, but if it is protected forests, we cant do anything at all.'
p7955
aS'If it is productive forests, then we have to go with the central government programme.'
p7956
aS'How important is it for foreign companies to build infrastructure?'
p7957
aS'I wish I can say here that Indonesia is a country with pre-built infrastructure, but unfortunately it is not.'
p7958
aS'Infrastructure is very important because currently, if we dont build our own infrastructure, we will have to use public roads.'
p7959
aS'And if the public roads are ruined because of our activity, then the image is damaged and the NGOs and everything will come in.'
p7960
aS'But if we have our infrastructure, then it wont bother the rest.'
p7961
aS'But some Indian companies are reluctant to come into Indonesia because of regulations?'
p7962
aS'Based on my experience, I will again say that do not acquire a small-size asset.'
p7963
aS'Maybe acquire a number of small-size assets and combine them into larger ones.'
p7964
aS'Because when you have a large asset, you have voice.'
p7965
aS'As long as the impact is sizeable, the government may look (again) at the regulations, but if the size is small, they will go straight.'
p7966
aS'I think if you want to come in, go with a bigger size and more money.'
p7967
aS'In a 5-10 year period, what do you see as the role of Indian companies in developing Indonesias coal mining sector?'
p7968
aS'The potential is great.'
p7969
aS'I have said it all along that the next big thing will be India coming into Indonesia for its energy needs.'
p7970
aS'I think we need to sit down together, between our associations, to inform each other of the right methods to come in, so that companies are here for long (periods).'
p7971
aS'But if you are not communicating with someone who knows (the sector) and has experience, then you might be frustrated.'

aS'Someone, who made more news in golf events than in the battle for market share.'
p8413
aS'But all that has changed.'
p8414
aS'With most multinational banks out of the retail race, Yes Bank is fast catching up on the big three in the private banking space and Rana Kapoor is talking about an American Depository Receipt issue-the holy grail of all institutions that seek to have a global status.'

p8702
aS'Deregulation would essentially give banks the freedom to set interest rates on savings accounts, which is currently fixed at 3.5%.'
p8703
aS"Theoretically, a consumer could get a higher interest rate on a savings account due to the move, but it all depends on the RBI's final decision."
p8704
aS'On Thursday, the central bank floated a discussion paper highlighting the pros and cons of deregulation, seeking public opinion on whether rates should be freed.'
p8705
aS'The central bank has also pointed out that real interest rates  interest rates adjusted for inflation  have been largely negative for savings account holders.'
p8706
aS'It said that savers would benefit from deregulation as rates are likely to rise.'
p8707
aS'It has also said that freeing of interest rates would improve transmission of monetary policy by pushing up interest rates on savings accounts whenever the central bank raised policy rates.'
p8708
aS'In the past Aditya Puri, MD, HDFC Bank, and Shikha Sharrma, MD, Axis Bank, had said that savings rate should not be deregulated when there is a liquidity shortage and interest rates are rising.'

aS'While banks would be induced to raise interest rates to mobilize savings deposits, funds may not flow freely as there would always be scepticism about changes in the interest rates structure unlike term deposits where the rates are fixed for a tenure, he added.'

aS'The new rates would be effective from 5 May, 2011, Indian Bank said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.'
p8976
aS'Already, five leading banks, including PNB, OBC and YES Bank, have increased their interest rates by half a percentage point with effect from today, making all loans costlier.'
p8977
aS'The announcements to hike rates came within a day of the Reserve Bank hiking its lending and borrowing rates by 50 basis points each.'
p8978
aS'Punjab National Bank (PNB), Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Bank of Maharashtra (BoM), IDBI Bank and YES Bank have also hiked their lending rates by 50 basis points.'
p8979
aS'With the increase, the base rate or the minimum lending rate for PNB, OBC, IDBI and BoM will stand increased to 10%, while that of private sector lender YES Bank will be 9.50%.'

aS'But the Yes Bank founder and CEO is no copycat, write Shyamal Majumdar and Somasroy Chakraborty.'
p8988
aS'Kapoor, 53, told us about his fascination for the cheetah much before Indias richest industrialist went public (in an interview to an economic daily) about his obsession with the leopard.'
p8989
aS'In fact, replicas of a cheetah sculpture that a colleague brought from South Africa have been adorning the tables of Yes Banks top 100 executives for the last two years.'
p8990
aS'They are meant to act  or so the banks boss hopes  as a constant reminder of the need to grow ahead of others.'
p8991
aS'We believe in seizing the opportunity every day.'
p8992
aS'The cheetah symbolises our internal agility.'
p8993
aS'I thought the message had to be seen by our top guys so that they can believe it, Kapoor tells us.'
p8994

p8995
aS'We are in a rather noisy corner of San-Qi on the ground floor of the Four Seasons Hotel in Mumbai  a venue Kapoor chose for the exotically named sea bass set, an assortment of rice and fish with steamed vegetables.'

aS'Try it, its really good, he says.'
p8997
aS'Since the rest of the menu is essentially Greek to us, we agree.'
p8998
aS'No leopard or cheetah would mind emulating the speed with which Kapoor orders and we quickly steer the conversation to new bank licences (the banking regulator and the finance ministry are considering the issue) and the experience of the founder of Indias youngest bank in dealing with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) when its licence application was being appraised.'
p8999
aS'He replies instantly: You need divine intervention to set up a bank in India!'
p9000
aS'Indeed, there was nothing remotely cheetah-like in the process he had to endure to procure a licence.'
p9001
aS'In our case, we applied for a licence in 1998.'
p9002
aS'But when new guidelines were announced in 2001, we had to make a fresh application.'
p9003
aS'In addition, an elaborate due diligence was done for about a year and a half, Kapoor says, adding he doesnt think it will be easier for aspirants this time either.'
p9004
aS'Instead of divine intervention, Kapoor says he is immensely grateful to the three-member committee headed by former RBI Governor I G Patel for having faith in the dreams of three professionals who didnt have pockets as deep as the other aspirants.'
p9005
aS'In 1995, Kapoor, his brother-in-law Ashok Kapur and colleague Harkirat Singh made a proposal to a visiting team from Rabobank for two joint ventures: a non-banking financial company (NBFC) and a bank.'
p9006
aS'Rabobank would control the NBFC and the three Indian partners would run the bank.'
p9007

p9010
aS'The food is served and we are glad that we had agreed to Kapoors suggestion; the baked fish is truly delicious.'
p9011
aS'Kapoor is talking about how Rabobank was supposed to pick up 26 per cent in Yes, suddenly developed cold feet but finally agreed to honour its commitment after much persuasion.'
p9012
aS'But with Rabobank now deciding to open its own bank in India, how does he see the competition?'
p9013
aS'Kapoor declines to comment specifically on Rabo, but says just as no Indian bank will be able to compete overseas with foreign banks for a very long time, no foreign bank will be able to compete with Indian banks.'
p9014
aS'The Yes Bank supremo, however, does not approve of the idea of allowing companies to open banks  one of the most hotly debated topics in the RBI discussion paper on new bank licences  saying banks should be standalone entities.'

p9021
aS'For instance  and he reels off the numbers extempore  the advances per branch of the old private banks (Rs 29.8 crore) are significantly lower than the industry aggregate (Rs 48.6 crore) and a third of the new private banks (Rs 91.8 crore).'
p9022
aS'The deposit per branch ratio shows a similar pattern.'
p9023
aS'The old private banks have not expanded nationally, which could have enabled them to provide banking services to a wider population base.'
p9024
aS'They registered the lowest branch growth among banking groups at 10 per cent against 29 per cent for the industry between 2005 and 2010.'
p9025
aS'In my judgement, these banks need to be galvanised without adding a lot of systemic risk.'
p9026
aS'Any new bank you bring in will add to systemic risk, Kapoor says.'
p9027
aS'The fish is getting cold, he reminds us, which was also a way of reminding himself to eat; hes been talking non-stop since we got in.We shift to a lighter topic to give him time to eat.'
p9028
aS'How did he choose Yes as the name for his bank?'
p9029
aS'We did not want to call it Kapoor ki hatti or Kapoor and Kapur (in reference to his late brother-in-law), he jokes.'
p9030
aS'One of our board members suggested the name, which was validated through a qualitative survey, he adds.'
p9031
aS'Inevitably, people made cracks that the bank should have been called No Bank and so on because of the endless wait for the licence, but he is happy that the bank has landed on its feet.'
p9032
aS'We are hoping that by 2015 it will emerge as one of the top national brands, he says with a triumphant grin.'
p9033
aS'The bank has just declared its ambitious Version 2.0 growth plan: by 2015, a compound annual growth rate in profits of 35 per cent, a balance sheet with Rs 1,25,000 crore in deposits, Rs 1,00,000 crore in loans, a net interest margin of 4 per cent and a return on equity of 22 to 24 per cent.'
p9034
aS'He also plans to increase the number of branches to 750 from 250, and ATMs to 2,500, his capital adequacy at 19 per cent is already among the highest, and Yes Bank has an international credit rating that is equivalent to Indias sovereign rating.'

aS'Not bad going for a man who in his early years worked in an assembly plant, as a library assistant and a clerk to part-finance his management education fees at the Rutgers University.'

aS'It was during a summer project in the late seventies at 399 Park Avenue, New York, the global headquarters of Citigroup, that Kapoor finally decided to pursue a career in banking.'
p9037
aS'Yes Bank, he says, is building a knowledge-driven culture in offbeat areas.'
p9038
aS'For example, the bank is hiring the best people from agricultural universities and making them learn the language of the bank.'
p9039
aS'One of its clients, for example, had a farm for a long time and gradually converted a part of it into a modern terminal market.'
p9040
aS'We also ask him about his succession plan, given that one of his three daughters has just joined the bank as a management trainee.'
p9041
aS'Kapoor insists its a temporary role because she isnt interested in hard-core banking.'
p9042
aS'In any case, Kapoor says, he doesnt see the role of a family member in the banks management at any point of time.'
p9043
aS'The lunch is over and the restaurant suddenly looks deserted.'
p9044
aS'As his car  a blue BMW 5 Series sedan  waits at the porch, Kapoor says the Yes Bank assignment is no longer a job for him.'
p9045
aS'It has become a hobby.'
p9046
aS'Even though the bank is fully institutionalised, to me it is like a son, the youngest baby in the family, he says, adding that the banks employees are all part of his extended family.'
p9047
aS'As we see him off, we think Kapoor, a voracious reader, would do well to read the frequent suggestion in management books that when the boss thinks you are family, run.'
p9048
aS'But going by its lower-than-industry attrition rate, Yes Banks employees obviously dont mind reciprocating the chairmans feelings.'

aS'The Maharashtra government has taken steps to enable the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC Bank) get refinance of up to Rs 2,160 crore for agricultural loans for 2011-12 from the National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (Nabard).'
p9050
aS'The state government has sought the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBIs) intervention to exempt MSC Bank from section 11 of the Banking Regulation Act, as the lenders net worth turned positive to Rs 238.14 crore as on March 31, against a negative Rs 144.22 crore a year ago.'
p9051
aS'Section 11 of the Act exempts any cooperative bank from continuing its business if its net worth is less than Rs 1 lakh.'
p9052
aS'We do not see any problem in MSC Bank getting refinance from Nabard for 2011-12 as the banks net worth is positive.'
p9053
aS'Necessary action has already been initiated by the state government for exempting MSC Bank from section 11.'
p9054
aS'This means the banks net worth is not less than Rs 1 lakh but it has turned positive as per the balance sheet of 2010-11 and, therefore, RBI is expected to accept our request and give its approval for MSC Bank to avail of the refinance from Nabard, a state government official, who did not want to be identified, told Business Standard.'
p9055
aS'The state government has superceded MSC Banks board of directors by appointing two administrators.'
p9056
aS'The commissioner of cooperative societies on the advice of RBI had superceded the bank on account of negative net worth as per the balance sheet of 2009-10.'
p9057
aS'The official informed that annual limit for refinance is Rs 2,160 crore for MSC Bank.'
p9058
aS'During 2010-11, MSC Bank had provided a total loan of Rs 3,300 crore to district central cooperative banks for agricultural loan purpose.'
p9059
aS'Of this, MSC Bank disbursed Rs 1,200 crore from its own funds.'
p9060
aS'Nabard sources declined to comment.'
p9061
aS'The government official reiterated that the MSC Bank was no longer under section 11 and thus was fully entitled for refinance from Nabard.'
p9062
aS'As reported by this paper recently, MSC Banks balance sheet for 2010-11, which is yet to be assessed by the statutory auditors, has clearly shown that the banks networth has turned positive to Rs 238.14 crore, its net interest margin increased to Rs 243.30 crore from Rs 100.15 crore in 2009-10.'
p9063
aS'The bank had earned an operative profit of Rs 15.82 crore while its net loss was reduced to Rs 506.43 crore from Rs 775.98 crore.'

aS'Arbitrage, uncertainty over end-use of funds prompted RBI move.'
p9065
aS'Stocks of most non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) were on a crash course on Wednesday, with the Reserve Bank of India excluding loans given to the sector from the priority sector list.'
p9066
aS'RBI on Wednesday clarified that bank loans to NBFCs, excluding microfinance institutions which are categorised as NBFC, would not be classified as priority sector loans.'
p9067
aS'This means the cost of funds of most NBFCs will go up.'
p9068
aS'NBFCs depend on banks for 80 per cent of their credit requirement.'
p9069
aS'About 10-12 per cent of the total bank loans are classified as priority sector loans.'
p9070
aS'A senior YES Bank executive said the rates on NBFC loans would definitely go up and there would also be some reduction of credit flow to the sector because some of these transactions were happening only because of priority sector classification.'
p9071
aS'I think credit flow will now shift to agriculture and SME, the executive said.'
p9072
aS'The objective behind the RBI move is to plug the arbitrage which arises due to the stringent conditions attached to bank loans to microfinance institutions.'
p9073
aS'For a bank loan to be classified as priority sector loan, banks are required to ensure a margin cap of 12 per cent and an interest rate cap of 26 per cent by the MFI.'
p9074
aS'Since no such conditions are there for all other NBFCs, banks would prefer giving loans to NBFCs rather than MFIs.'
p9075
aS'RBI Deputy Governor KC Chakrabarty said the central bank would not allow arbitrage position in respect of financing to the NBFCs.'
p9076
aS'Lack of clarity on the end use of NBFC funds has also led to such a move.'
p9077
aS'The year-on-year loan growth to NBFCs was rapid last year.'
p9078
aS'A lot of financial institutions were funding car and commercial vehicle loans.'
p9079
aS'There was a huge demand for cars and a large part of it was met by NBFCs.'
p9080
aS'So we thought that we need to look at the ground reality, said Shyamala Gopinath, deputy governor, RBI.'
p9081
aS'Though as of now bank loans to MFIs will be tagged as priority sector, the central bank clearly said this was an interim arrangement and banks would have to meet their priority sector obligations on their own.'
p9082
aS'Banks are the financial intermediaries.'
p9083
aS'If there is financial inclusion obligation on them, why should they do it through other institutions?'
p9084
aS'Now, microfinance is a vulnerable section of society and banks do not have the capacity to cater to the needs of this segment, so this is an intermediary arrangement.'
p9085
aS'And if banks are to lend to any other NBFC and they are not satisfying the need of priority sector, then this creates an arbitrage situation.'
p9086
aS'So, for now, this has been stopped.'
p9087
aS'We cannot allow arbitrage position in respect of financing to the NBFC, said Chakrabarty.'
p9088
aS'NBFCs, however, put on a brave face saying the latest RBI norms would not affect them much.'
p9089
aS'We are not impacted at all as for us most of the borrowing is on commercial terms where there is no concession on rates, said R Sridhar, managing director, Shriram Transport Finance Co.\nInvestors, however, were not too sure.'

p9093
aS'"Since petroleum is an intermediary product, it enters into transportation cost.'
p9094

p9098
aS'The rate of headline, based on monthly WPI, for April was 8.66%, down from 9.04% a month ago.'
p9099
aS'Inflation can reach double digit any time this year, Chandrashekhar said, adding "the government is trying to defend the rise in petrol prices by saying that it can\'t do anything because the decision is taken by oil marketing companies."'
p9100
aS'Commenting on the decision to raise petrol prices, Yes Bank Chief Economist Shubhada M Rao said, "based on the April inflation numbers, the direct impact of the petrol price hike on headline WPI inflation would be around 10 bps."'
p9101
aS'Given the current inflation level which is likely to remain elevated until November closer to 9% levels, Rao said, "we do expect the RBI to hike repo rate by another 50-75 bps during the course of the year."'
p9102
aS'Echoing views, Joshi said, "The RBI will have to increase the interest rates by 50 basis points in the course of year."'
p9103
aS'The Reserve Bank on May 3 raised its key lending rates by 50 basis points, for the ninth time since March 2010, to tame rising prices.'

p9107
aS'The second LAF was being conducted from end-January till this Friday.'

aS'Banks were borrowing at 7.25 per cent to meet the shortfall in reserve requirements.'
p9109
aS'In the new Marginal Standing Facility (MSF), banks will have to borrow at 100 basis points more than the repo rate, which is 7.25 per cent now.'
p9110
aS'While borrowing from the second LAF was a regular exercise, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) says MSF can be availed only under exceptional circumstances.'
p9111
aS'It issued the MSF guidelines on Monday.'
p9112
aS'While banks are mandated to maintain at least 24 per cent of all net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as the Statutory Liquidity Ratio, they may borrow overnight up to one per cent of their respective NDTL under the MSF scheme.'
p9113
aS'The one per cent leeway was earlier available at the repo rate.'
p9114
aS'Currently the repo rate is 7.25 per cent, reverse repo at 6.25 per cent and the MSF is at 8.25 per cent.'
p9115
aS'RBI governor D Subbarao had said in the annual monetary and credit policy announcement last week that the MSF was an exceptional facility and banks were expected to exhaust the opportunities in the market repo and Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligations (CBLO) before accessing the MSF.'
p9116
aS'As a result in a liquidity deficit situation, the short-term rates like call money, CBLO and market repo will move in the corridor between the repo rate and the MSF rate.'
p9117
aS'In case these rates go beyond the MSF rate, it will attract RBIs attention and may prompt a liquidity easing action, said a bond dealer with a public sector bank.'
p9118
aS'Also, MSF requests would not be made public, unlike the case in LAF auctions.'
p9119
aS'The declaration of MSF transactions may shock the call money market, as it will clearly show that liquidity situation is tight and banks are borrowing at a penal rate, said a treasury head with a public sector bank.'

aS'The MSF will be conducted on the lines of the LAF repo between 3.30 and 4.30 pm.'
p9121
aS'The working group on the operating procedure of monetary policy, chaired by RBI executive director Deepak Mohanty, had recommended permanent continuation of this facility.'
p9122
aS'The repo borrowings in the second LAF were higher than the initial auction everyday, indicating that banks were heavily using the second LAF window.'
p9123
aS'The second LAF was helpful, as the RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) transactions are higher towards the end of the day and so would be the need for funds, said the treasury official.'
p9124
aS'Short-term retail fixed deposit (FD) rates have gone up sharply in the past few days, with banks offering better rates on deposits up to six months, as they expect that interest rates will soften in the long term.'

p9134
aS'After the policy announcement, a number of banks effected deposit rate increases but only as an adjustment to the new interest rate on savings account.'

aS'The rate hikes were to make short-term deposit products more attractive as compared to the four per cent being offered on savings bank accounts, said a senior official with Union Bank of India.'

p9317
aS'According to Tirodkar, a four per cent rate rise alone has translated to an interest payment increase of Rs 600 crore for his companies.'
p9318
aS'But the problem is, there has been a sharp drop in revenues and cash flows due to the current squeeze in the scam-tainted telecom sector, which has triggered low capital expenditure, lesser spending, muted growth and a falling demand.'

aS'Today there is a serious challenge for infrastructure, especially telecom players, to raise money either debt or equity.'

p9323
aS'The company has close to Rs 4,000 crore leverage, and sources in the banking industry said, its largely unsecured.'
p9324
aS'The worry is many of the lenders have agreed to offer a credit line to a company which does not have assets on the ground.'
p9325
aS'Its a service provider, much like an EPC contractor.'
p9326
aS'And many of the lenders have very high provision on these loans, said a senior banking official on condition of anonymity as his bank has exposure in the company.'
p9327
aS'While GTL infrastructure owns the assets and earns rental income, GTL sells the equipment and offers other services to operators.'
p9328
aS'GTL has also made investments in GTL Infrastructure, and the bankers said it holds many of the bank guarantees, so if GTL starts defaulting, the crisis will snowball.'
p9329
aS'For them, GTL Ltd is like a de-facto holding company for GTL Infra.'
p9330
aS'The lenders have a prescription without affecting the business model.'
p9331
aS'For them GTL needs an immediate equity infusion of Rs 2,500 crore to balance the debt to equity ratio.'
p9332
aS'Part of that, some bankers felt, may get structured by some of the existing lenders themselves through convertible instruments like bonds or debentures and preference shares.'
p9333
aS'The rest around Rs 500-Rs 800 crore will have to pumped in by the promoter himself by monetising unencumbered assets like real estate.'

p9470
aS'Our exposure to interbank call money market is very marginal.'
p9471
aS'The good thing is that we are seeing our branch liabilities rapidly augmenting.'
p9472
aS'We closed fiscal 2011 with the Casa (current and savings accounts) of around 10% and retail liabilities slightly more than 27%.'
p9473
aS'The recurring nature of our liability base has actually been very stable during the (2009 financial) crisis and has shown fantastic traction in the post-crisis period.'
p9474
aS'Any liquidity risk?'
p9475
aS'I would classify our liquidity risk at somewhere between low to moderate.'
p9476
aS'Dont you run any asset-liability mismatches?'
p9477
aS'On the contrary, our asset-liability profile has a structural positive mismatch because the average tenure of our deposit base is about 21 months and loans about 18 month.'
p9478
aS'Also, it is important to realize that almost 60% of our loans are linked to our PLR (prime lending rate), which means that we have limited pricing risk.'
p9479

p9483
aS'In fact, our five-year growth plan revolves around liability growth.'

p9485
aS'In 2011, Casa grew by 69%, but total deposits grew in excess of 71%.'
p9486
aS'As a relatively young and emerging bank, it is important for us to build granularity of deposits across all businesses in market segments.'
p9487
aS'We are extremely confident that by 2015, we should endeavour towards achieving 30% Casa.'
p9488
aS'To achieve that, all the building blocks are increative technologies, training of people, the payments architecture, roll-out of branches, cash management mandates.'
p9489
aS'Because of higher cost of funds, your net interest margin (NIM) is a pretty low 2.8%.'
p9490
aS'With interest rates going up, wont your NIM be under pressure?'
p9491
aS'I want to make one point that within Casa, over 80% for us is CA (current accounts) and the balance 20% is SA (savings accounts).'
p9492
aS'Economically, the value of our 10% Casa is more than the equivalent of a 15-16% Casa in those banks which have more SA than CA.'
p9493
aS'When savings rates get deregulated, it will be a colossal opportunity for a bank like ours.'
p9494
aS'We will pay more as we believe that savings rates should be inflation neutral.'

p9496
aS'We would like to believe that we would benchmark this somewhat with policy rates as well as the new normal inflation.'
p9497
aS'In our assessment, the new normal in inflation for the next one or two years may well be 6-6.5%.'

p9513
aS'Rabo came into Yes Bank as a key financial investor with one board seat.'
p9514
aS'They always had an aspiration to build a stand-alone India model after having experienced India through the Rabo India Finance venture, where I was the CEO earlier.'
p9515
aS'Most definitely they saw that the opportunity in India has been very compelling after whatever modest success we have been able to achieve at Yes Bank.'
p9516
aS'In accordance with their board plans, they have gone in for an independent licence and in accordance with RBI requirement, they had to reduce ownership below 5%.'
p9517
aS'This was done in June 2010.'
p9518
aS'They are at best now a passive investor with a less than 5% stake.'
p9519
aS'Will Rabo continue to hold the stake?'
p9520
aS'At least they maintain that they would like to keep it this way.'
p9521
aS'Do you have any model in front of you?'
p9522
aS'By 2015, we should be very balanced in terms of the overall composition of assetsour corporate business, which is 67% now, should be about 40% and the mid-market SME (small and medium enterprises) part of the bank should grow from 23% to 30%.'
p9523
aS'The balance 30% will be retail.'
p9524
aS'The two banks that we constantly benchmark ourselves against are Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.'
p9525
aS'We would like to believe that we will be a best of breed combination of both by 2015.'
p9526
aS'To achieve the retail business target, you need to grow at about 97% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate).'
p9527
aS'Is it achievable?'
p9528
aS'In 2010, retail business combined with branch banking was just about 5% of our total advances.'
p9529
aS'In 2011, it constitutes 12% and our strategy is to increase that to 30% by 2015.'
p9530
aS'It is very doable because we are on track.'
p9531
aS'We have built about 100 branches in the last 12 months and plan to raise the branch network to 750 by September 2015.'
p9532
aS'The RBI norm says that for every three branches you set up in urban India, you would need to have one rural branch.'
p9533
aS'Is it in sync with your model?'
p9534
aS'There is also a dispensation from RBI that enables us to actually choose such branches between tier III and tier VI centres.'
p9535
aS'Our people in branch banking and retail banking actually have identified some very promising locations, which are emerging rapidly.'
p9536
aS'We see lots of agri pockets in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, parts of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, parts of Uttar Pradesh where our inclusive and social banking division is working towards building viable models.'
p9537
aS'So whether these are technology-driven or bricks and mortar branches or a combination of both, supported by business correspondents there is a compelling model.'
p9538
aS'Inclusive banking is going to be a profitable model.'
p9539
aS'It may take the next three years.'
p9540
aS'You are talking about inclusive banking, but you recalled Rs 100 crore worth of loans from the troubled microfinance institutions.'
p9541
aS'We had one or two instances in early January where we found that a couple of microlenders, which subsequently got into CDRs (corporate debt restructurings), were collecting (loan repayments) faster than disbursing (loans).'
p9542
aS'Please remember that in certain companies, the collections were fairly normal except in one state.'
p9543
aS'So companies were sitting on cash and not disbursing the cash towards new loans.'
p9544
aS'It was important in a couple of cases to actually get those loans repaid, but we have been equally fast in terms of new disbursements.'
p9545
aS'What is your total exposure to the microfinance sector?'
p9546
aS'About Rs 250 crore.'
p9547
aS'We are working increasingly towards securitized structures.'
p9548
aS'SMEs are quite vulnerable to an economic slowdown.'
p9549
aS'Do you see the quality of assets suffering this fiscal?'
p9550
aS'At present, our SME exposure is just around 10% or so.'
p9551
aS'As big as your exposure to retail?'
p9552
aS'Well, actually more than that.'
p9553
aS'At this point, the SME segment is one business that we really like.'
p9554
aS'We have a model supported by well-trained relationship managers and credit specialists, who were deployed on a regional basis.'
p9555
aS'We are sectoral and knowledge-driven in the implementation of our strategy and I must say that the SME segment is really driven by owner-manager-partners and the owners basically see their business as their lifeline.'
p9556
aS'The SMEs are susceptible to economic cycles, but they change gear...'
p9557
aS'There may be some delays...\nAre you seeing such delays?'
p9558
aS'Actually we see that the survival instincts of SMEs are by far the best in our country.'
p9559
aS'We need to customize lending packages; need to know the promoters, owners, managers of these SMEs.'
p9560
aS'They have the ability.'
p9561
aS'They are entrepreneurs; run low-cost structures and I think this is the segment we have to invest in.'
p9562
aS'Your Wharton-educated daughter Rakhi has joined the bank.'
p9563
aS'She is an entrepreneur and is learning the tricks of the trade here.'
p9564
aS'Rakhi has done her MBA (Master of Business Administration) in entrepreneurial management.'
p9565
aS'So is there a sort of informal succession plan?'
p9566
aS'Not really.'
p9567
aS'You have six years to retire.'
p9568
aS'Will you use this period to groom Rakhi?'
p9569
aS'My daughter wanted to train because this is an enterprising platform.'
p9570
aS'But your other daughter, an entrepreneur, is doing some other work.'
p9571
aS'Two of my three daughters have completed their education and both of them want to be women business leaders.'
p9572
aS'The second one is training with me.'
p9573
aS'They will be on their own at some stage.'
p9574
aS'So Rakhi will not succeed you in this bank?'
p9575
aS'Not really.'
p9576
aS'The important thing, I will tell you very honestly, is beyond ownership.'
p9577
aS'Yes Bank has very divine intervention in my professional life as well as in the lives of many of my top management colleagues and partners, and I think the institutionalization of Yes Bank today is its biggest strength.'
p9578
aS'I can think of at least three or four of my colleagues who are eligible at some time in the future to take over from me.'
p9579
aS'There isnt any succession plan in the very short term that we are contemplating.'
p9580
aS'I personally dont want to see anybody in the family being involved in any form (in running the bank).'
p9581
aS'You own 26.7% in Yes Bank.'
p9582
aS'The market value of your stake is around Rs 2,650 crore.'
p9583
aS'Are you looking for an opportune moment to cash out?'
p9584
aS'This is the market perception and the popular belief is that youre drumming up the banks valuation for this.'
p9585
aS'I want to be very, very upfront with you on this issue.'
p9586
aS'Yes Bank is a beautiful professional journey and I think the sustainability of this model, the endurance of this model, and the fact that it has performed best during and post- (financial) crisis definitely reflect on its core business and financial strengths.'
p9587
aS'We have a very long-term horizon in terms of building the bank.'
p9588
aS'So the entrepreneur in Rana Kapoor will never say lets cash out and do something else?'
p9589
aS'I have no plan to monetize my stake for a very long time to come.'
p9590
aS'I believe that banking is such a beautiful profession and you contribute to national development, if done properly.'

p9674

p9675
aS'On the domestic front, the reasons are higher-than-expected inflation, rate tightening, the earnings downgrade cycle, slowing demand in many sectors, cost pressure from higher raw material prices, wages and interest rates, a deteriorating fiscal situation due to higher crude prices and low investment growth.'
p9676

p9681
aS'Do you expect the second half of FY12 to be better than the first half?'
p9682
aS'Our base case view for a better second half (which is currently the consensus view) is driven by the view that we will see a soft landing from a gross domestic product (GDP) growth perspective  both in India (7.6 per cent is our estimate for FY12) and globally.'
p9683
aS'We expect inflation to come off in the second half of FY12 due to slower demand growth and likely lower financial speculation in commodities as liquidity conditions tighten.'
p9684
aS'We do not expect a more than 25 basis point (bp) rate hike going ahead, as a number of operating data points like the credit offtake, the sales growth of cement, steel, autos, etc, are softening quite dramatically.'
p9685
aS'Also, we believe the earnings downgrade cycle would have ceased by the second half and hope there will be some movement on the policy front and investments will pick up.'

aS'We peg the Sensex earnings in the range of Rs 1,400-1,450.'
p9690
aS'When do you expect the capital expansion cycle to pick up?'
p9691
aS'Unless the macro conditions deteriorate further, which is not our base case, we believe the worst is behind us.'
p9692
aS'The investment cycle should pick up later this year on lower year-end inflation, rate tightening coming to an end and some governmental policy action.'
p9693
aS'Do you expect further contraction in the Ebitda margins of companies?'
p9694
aS'There is a slowdown in demand across multiple sectors (y-o-y in comparison with FY11) and factors like high raw material prices, wages, interest rates, etc, are not working out in favour of many sectors.'
p9695
aS'Therefore, we expect the Ebitda margins to contract.'
p9696
aS'The banking sector would be impacted by low credit offtake and high cost deposits, while the information technology (IT) sector would be impacted by large wage hikes.'
p9697
aS'Revenues for frontline IT stocks such as Infosys and Wipro were below estimates in the last quarter.'
p9698
aS'Do you see things improving?'
p9699
aS'We have been cautious on the IT sector from a structural perspective since October 2010.'
p9700
aS'We believe the medium-term demand growth may not be as strong as the market is anticipating.'
p9701
aS'The strong growth in 2010 was due to one-offs and large spending by the BFSI (Banking and Financial Services) segment, which may not be repeated in 2011.'
p9702
aS'We believe some of the Indian companies would now fall in the top 5 bracket from a volume perspective and to expect them to grow at 3-4x the market growth for two-three years is unreasonable.'
p9703
aS'The companies that have very large exposure to the BFSI sector will be impacted by the hit on profitability.'
p9704
aS'Which sectors, in your opinion, are likely to do well in FY12?'
p9705

aS'But we have decided to visit the market to raise funds at least once in the next three years.'
p9721
aS'It will happen towards the end of 2012.'
p9722
aS'Is your capital raising plan also driven by the need to cut promoters holdings?'
p9723
aS'Our capital raising programme will always be driven by balance sheet requirements.That will also lead to a dilution in promoters holdings.'
p9724
aS'There is an understanding between our promoters and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on dilution of their stake.'
p9725
aS'They are committed to it.'
p9726
aS'They have brought down their stake to 19 per cent from 27 per cent earlier.'
p9727
aS'But we will not raise money only to dilute promoters stake in the bank.'

p9735
aS'To start with, they will have to meet various obligations.'
p9736
aS'I dont think any new player can afford to buy market share by sacrificing margins.'

p9868

p9891
aS'Most new private banks which have already drawn up branch expansion plans in large cities have decided to go ahead even if this means having to identify places that have never seen a bank branch before.'
p9892
aS"Private banks are taking the change in policy in their stride although some feel RBI's policy increases the onus on smaller banks."

p9895
aS'Axis Bank, which had drawn up plans to open around 250 branches this fiscal, will have to open 60 branches in unbanked areas.'

p9897
aS'RBI, in its circular, said that "banks should allocate at least 25% of the total number of branches proposed to be opened during a year in unbanked rural (tier 5 and tier 6) centres."'
p9898
aS'An unbanked rural centre would mean a rural (tier 5 and tier 6) centre that does not have a brick-and-mortar structure of any scheduled commercial bank for customer-based banking transactions," the circular said.'
p9899

aS'The rural directive could be a setback albeit a small one for new generation private banks which have turned into profit machines with earning growing over 20%.'

aS'Edited excerpts:\nIn August last year, Kotak Bank sold 4.5% stake to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. (SMBC)for Rs 1,366 crore.'
p9917
aS'What have you done with the money?'
p9918
aS'It was new money into the bank and the purpose of it was to really leverage this for further growth of the bank, combined with building a relationship with a Japanese financial institution.'
p9919
aS'We are making significant progress in terms of building the relationship with SMBC, including in the area of asset management.'
p9920
aS'We are also jointly sponsoring an infrastructure fund.'
p9921
aS'Signs of slowdown: Kotak says his expectation for the real economy is about 7.5% GDP growth, down from 8.5%.'

aS'Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintIn fiscal 2011, we grew in excess of 30% and we see ourselves growing at a decent level in future.'
p9923
aS'The short-term objective is to expand the balance sheet and, at the same time, we are keeping our eyes open for appropriate acquisition opportunities.'
p9924
aS'You are quite small.'
p9925
aS'Even Yes Bank Ltd, a greenfield bank which got a licence around the same time when you converted your then 18-year-old lease finance and bill discounting firm into a bank, is larger than Kotak Bank in terms of assets.'
p9926
aS'I think you should look at our consolidated balance sheet, which is well in excess of Rs 75,000 crore, significantly larger than Yes Bank.'
p9927
aS'Our approach to banking is very different from the traditional banks, or even some of the new banks.'
p9928
aS'We do not necessarily go out and write single-cheque, large-ticket loans.'
p9929
aS'We have traditionally built our asset base in a number of areas, which most banks dont like to be in.'
p9930
aS'We are one of the largest financiers in tractors; 20% of our balance sheet is agriculture loans; we are pretty significant in commodity financing.'
p9931
aS'We are also one of the larger players in commercial vehicles and construction equipment.'
p9932
aS'Whats your business model?'
p9933
aS'Our entire approach to the banking and financial services business is risk-adjusted returns.'
p9934
aS'We believe that in most parts of the world and including pockets in India, banking tends to mis-price risk.'
p9935
aS'Our approach is to get into a segment and build that if we believe that on a risk-adjusted basis we will get our RoA (return on assets) and RoE (return on equity).'
p9936
aS'Whats the difference between Kotak Bank and others?'
p9937
aS'There are three or four significant differences.'
p9938
aS'One, we came from an era of NBFC (non-banking financial company) and we have tried to preserve the good aspects of that era.'
p9939
aS'I think NBFCs have developed specializations in verticals like commercial vehicles, tractors, cars, construction equipment, etc., and we have preserved the asset side of the balance sheet beyond becoming a bank.'
p9940
aS'Our internal mantra is we would like to build a business model, which borrows from India and lends to Bharat.'
p9941
aS'To be politically correct?'
p9942
aS'No, thats how the business model is working.'
p9943
aS'We are extremely focused on building some of the assets which are going into mid-India, semi-urban and rural, and thats our DNA.'
p9944
aS'We are building a retail bank and a lot of the deposit base is still in urban India.'
p9945
aS'Borrow from India and lend to Bharat is not a nice political statement.'
p9946
aS'Its in fact something which we genuinely believe in and practice...'
p9947
aS'Your net interest margin (NIM) of 5.6% is the highest among Indian banks.'
p9948
aS'There are three or four parts of NIM.'
p9949
aS'First, it comes from our legacy as an NBFC, which is very vertical focused.'
p9950
aS'That is actually coming from a deep DNA or focus on risk-adjusted returns.'
p9951
aS'About two-thirds of our balance sheet is retail where NIM is higher, but our operating costs are also higher.'
p9952
aS'You have to look at NIMs along with the operating cost.'
p9953
aS'The third point is that our capital adequacy is high and this means we have interest-free money to add to our NIM.'
p9954
aS'Finally, there are certain accounting issues.'
p9955
aS'Let me give you an exampleif you give a loan and you charge upfront fee, is it interest or fee?'
p9956
aS'It depends on how an accounting view of some of these items are taken.'
p9957
aS'We have been booking this as (interest) income and that is perfectly legitimate.'
p9958
aS'Two-thirds of your book is retail.'
p9959
aS'Isnt that risky?'
p9960
aS'We think its a safer business rather than giving big-ticket concentrated infrastructure loans today when there is a question mark on execution of infrastructure projects.'
p9961
aS'I would much rather give loans on tractors and commercial vehicles to people in Bharat where we think the payment culture is much better than some parts of corporate India.'
p9962
aS'How has been the credit demand?'
p9963
aS'We found credit demand to be pretty good despite the perception of a slowdown.'
p9964
aS'For the current year, we see the growth broadly in the range of around the 30% mark.'
p9965
aS'We have to watch the year and see how the economy grows, but we think that if the broader credit demand of the economy is about 20%, we should grow at around 30%.'
p9966
aS'This is achievable by us and our business model enables us to get these levels of growth, and we think that the fundamental real economy is in a reasonable shape.'
p9967
aS'Arent you seeing any signs of a slowdown?'
p9968
aS'I think there are some aspects of the economy slowing a bit.'
p9969
aS'My expectation for the real economy is about 7.5% GDP growth, down from 8.5%, but I think its a pause, as India takes a deep breath and figures out how it goes from here.'
p9970
aS'Are corporations going slow in lifting loans?'
p9971
aS'You need to divide the borrowers into two-three parts.'
p9972
aS'The first is anything to do with projects and infrastructuretheres a huge amount of execution challenges.'
p9973
aS'The entire area of brownfield investment is going on.'
p9974
aS'You seem to have reservations about infrastructure projects.'
p9975
aS'We are cautious about concentrated large-ticket loans, particularly to greenfield infrastructure.'
p9976
aS'That caution comes not so much from the point of view of the businesses, but from the governance and execution challenges which India faces today.'
p9977
aS'Are you seeing borrowers asking for loan restructuring because of project delays?'
p9978
aS'We havent faced that problem because our exposure is so low.'
p9979
aS'As a bank, we dont like the culture of debt restructuring.'
p9980
aS'Its wrong whether it is in Greece or corporate India.'
p9981
aS'Are you ready to set up the infrastructure fund with SMBC?'
p9982
aS'We believe that the infrastructure space in the next 12-18 months will actually reach the bottom and get better, and thats the time when we think investment opportunities will come.'
p9983
aS'Therefore, its a good time to be setting up an infrastructure fund.'
p9984
aS'If you are too early you made the wrong investments, if you are too late you miss the bus.'
p9985
aS'You have reservations about infrastructure loans, but comfortable floating a private equity fund in the space.'
p9986
aS'There are two aspects.'
p9987
aS'We spoke about mis-pricing risk.'
p9988
aS'If you are doing debt lending to infrastructure companies with equity kind of risks, it is a bad trade.'
p9989
aS'If its an equity risk, you must get equity returns.'
p9990
aS'We think as the cycle corrects, there will be opportunities in infrastructure which will be equity risks for equity kind of returns.'
p9991
aS'If I am taking equity risks, I dont want to be lending fixed rate money.'
p9992
aS'In equities, you price the risk.'
p9993
aS'As far as debt is concerned, if the markets get more sophisticated where for the levels of risks that you take you get the debt returns, we will certainly look at it.'
p9994
aS'Its back to a philosophy of risk-adjusted returns.'
p9995
aS'What kind of return?'
p9996
aS'It depends on levels of risks and also at what stage of evolution of the infrastructure financing cycle you are entering.'
p9997
aS'If you are taking project risks, which is the first three-four years of a project, your returns on that debt will be very different from an annuity risk, post a project having being completed.'
p9998
aS'We will be in the business in the next 12 months.'
p9999
aS'Has the interest rates peaked?'
p10000
aS'We think we are close to the peak.'
p10001
aS'We will peak at probably around 8%.'
p10002
aS'It will happen between now and October.'
p10003
aS'You have been talking about acquisitions for the past one year.'
p10004
aS'When will you walk the talk?'
p10005
aS'In every interview of mine this is a question which is asked and rather than me responding to the question, let me do the walk and then do the talk.'
p10006
aS'This is something which we would like to do.'
p10007
aS'If we get an opportunity which is interesting, at the right price and on the right terms, we will look at it very seriously.'
p10008
aS'We are eager,?but not desperate.'
p10009
aS'When you look at the Indian banking scene, there is a lot out there, but the choices are pretty clear.'
p10010
aS'There are three or four choices which we looked at.'
p10011
aS'Looking at old private banks in south India?'
p10012
aS'For us the acquisition field is in three areasbanking, broking, asset management.'
p10013
aS'We are looking at this entire space and not necessarily only at banks.'
p10014
aS'Of course, banking is our first choice, but we are also open to broking and asset management.'
p10015
aS'You can buy portfolios also.'
p10016
aS'For us, the branch distribution is important.'
p10017
aS'We are looking at buying distribution and not just assets.'
p10018
aS'Promoter stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank is about 46% even though the Reserve Bank of India ownership norms capped the promoter stake at 10%...\nFirstly, when we became a bank in 2003, the licensing condition was that the promoters shall hold a minimum of 49% for a minimum period of five years.'
p10019
aS'Therefore, till 2008, we were obliged by our licensing condition to hold 49%, required by the policy regime in 2003.'
p10020
aS'Post 2003, there was a change in philosophy and thinking.'
p10021
aS'Based on that, you saw ownership and governance guidelines of 2005.'
p10022
aS'If you go through the ownership and governance guidelines along with the guidelines of 2004, you will see they provide for ownership higher than 10%, up to 30% and above 30%, subject to the criteria being fulfilled.'
p10023

aS'ICICI Bank, Indias largest private sector bank, on Thursday said it would launch two new home loan products with interest rates fixed for one and two years  a reminder of the earlier teaser loan schemes.'
p10218
aS"Such fixed-cum-floating housing loan schemes had disappeared from the market after the Reserve Bank of India expressed concerns that these products may affect banks' asset quality."
p10219
aS'Under the new loan scheme of ICICI Bank, a customer can avail a housing loan at a fixed rate of interest for one or two years, after which the interest rate would become floating.'
p10220
aS'In the one-year fixed rate home loan scheme, loans up to Rs 25 lakh will be given at 10.50 per cent, loans of Rs 25-75 lakh at 11 per cent and those above Rs 75 lakh at 11.50 per cent.'

aS'So, if the banks base rate rises (currently, it is 10 per cent), the floating rate will also move up.'
p10225
aS'If the minimum lending rate is reduced, the floating rate will also be lower.'
p10226
aS'It cannot be called a teaser rate product since the floating rate may not be higher than the fixed rate if the base rate falls.'

aS'In SBIs case, the floating rate was already decided at a higher level than the fixed rate, a banker said.'

aS'ICICI Bank has not defined the floating rate of interest it will charge.'
p10237
aS'It said the floating rate would be linked to ICICI Bank Base Rate (I-Base) plus margin decided at the time of sanction of the loan.'
p10238
aS'To discourage banks from offering teaser rate schemes, the RBI had increased the standard asset provisioning for all such loans to 2 per cent from 0.4 per cent.'

aS'Edited excerpts:\nWhy do you want to become a bank?'
p10653
aS'For access to cheap money?'

p10655
aS'Hemant Mishra/MintNo, our aspiration has always been to build an integrated financial services business in India, and very gradually we have built everything that exists in financial services world, except commercial banking.'
p10656
aS'Purely from a customer servicing proposition, having a bank helps all our businesses and enables us to offer better delivery.'
p10657
aS'You already have a non-banking finance company (NBFC) and are lending money.'
p10658
aS'Its not about credit, its about servicing.'
p10659
aS'If you look at the businesses that we are in, whether its our life insurance or asset management or retail brokerage business, having a bank allows us to help service our customers far better than what we do.'
p10660
aS'The customers have to go to multiple places because all of themwhether they are in mass affluent segment or the rural segment or even large corporateswant one-stop shop for all their financial needs.'
p10661
aS'A bank allows you to do that.'
p10662
aS'I dont think it is about cheap money or depositsits about achieving our aspiration of building an integrated financial services business.'
p10663
aS'This would come in full shape when we have a banking service alongside it.'
p10664
aS'Also a bank will help you move up the value chain.'
p10665
aS'Absolutely.'
p10666
aS'Historically most Indian banks have generated a significant amount of shareholders wealth.'
p10667
aS'But besides that, financial services industry in India is very trust-driven because mass retail clients like to bank or deal with the firm in which they have very high trust propositions.'
p10668
aS'Fiduciary businesses like banks, asset management and life insurance build credibility and trust among customers.'
p10669
aS'I dont think our management cant generate value for shareholders without the bank.'
p10670
aS'We have done this over a period of time, but in order to get the full wallet share of all our customers, a bank is needed.'
p10671
aS'Thats what you want.'
p10672
aS'But what will consumers get from you?'
p10673
aS'We already have 78 banks in the country.'
p10674
aS'The challenges have been that 70% of Indian banks are technically government-owned and there is no innovation.'
p10675
aS'While economy continues to grow at 8% or more and savings at 42% of GDP (gross domestic product), we see under-penetration everywhere whether it is lending, equities or asset management.'
p10676
aS'There is no innovation happening in the financial services market.'
p10677
aS'The old players have no incentive to innovate because they are busy managing their current size.'
p10678
aS'A new player has the compulsion to innovate and bring down the cost of delivery and services.'
p10679
aS'The business is not different from what is happening in the telecom and airline industries.'
p10680
aS'You are making a sweeping statementthere is no innovation in the financial sector.'
p10681
aS'The first level of innovation has been done by the new private banks.'
p10682
aS'They have been very innovative and brought the first generation of change.'
p10683
aS'Again, when \nKotak (Mahindra Bank) and Yes Bank were granted licences, they had done some level of innovations.'
p10684
aS'Its very difficult for an existing large business to transform and do something unique, because the risk-reward proposition of the changes is not in their favour.'
p10685
aS'Im not saying that they have not done that; Im saying the new people will probably do better.'
p10686
aS'We have been through 9-10 countries and seen multiple models of banking business.'
p10687
aS'We have seen models where new banks have used banking inclusions and made themselves very profitable.'
p10688
aS'Every bank keeps saying that financial inclusion will not be profitable.'
p10689
aS'But, what I believe is that these new players can bring that innovation.'
p10690
aS'So if you get the banking licence, your focus will be on rural India, and financial inclusion will be the theme of your business.'
p10691
aS'If we get the licence, it will be a balanced business.'
p10692
aS'We are not a global multinational corporation that can enter this country, make promises to regulators and policymakers, dont fulfil them and go out.'
p10693
aS'That is not possible for us as this is our home market.'
p10694
aS'If the policymakers want and rightfully so that the balance 40% of the unbanked population should be banked, we would surely make that as one of the most strategic components of our business.'
p10695
aS'But simultaneously, we will also make this business viable and profitable.'
p10696
aS'How will you be different from others?'
p10697
aS'I cant get into the details of our plans as I dont want others to replicate what we are trying to do.'
p10698
aS'A lot of investment has gone into making the plan.'
p10699
aS'But broadly there are three or four things that we are trying to do.'
p10700
aS'We are not establishing a bank to drive the value; we are establishing it because it is core to us.'
p10701
aS'Second, the proposition cannot be built just by us.'
p10702
aS'We have been looking to create a model of partnerships.'
p10703
aS'A lot of people say why the founders of the banking business are being pushed to dilute so quickly.'
p10704
aS'They see a loss of value.'
p10705
aS'We have always believed that even if our starting point is low, then too we are happy.'
p10706
aS'If someone can partner with us, then we can win, because on our own we cannot bring in new innovations, technologies, processes.'
p10707
aS'We are looking globally and domestically to find right partners or people, maybe a financial set of investors, but who have access to knowledge.'
p10708
aS'As of now, you can hold a minimum of 40% stake in the bank.'
p10709
aS'This means you can offer 60% to a group of partners.'
p10710
aS'We will have to see the final guidelines.'
p10711
aS'Most of these partners would like to hold significantly because 5% doesnt interest them much.'
p10712
aS'For the amount of efforts and resources they would provide, they would like to capture the economic value of that.'
p10713
aS'But whether it is 40% or 50%, we dont differentiate in the business the intensity and passion about the same.'
p10714
aS'Have you started talking to anybody?'
p10715
aS'We are speaking to a lot of people, but at this point every body is waiting to see what the final shape will be.'
p10716
aS'But there is a huge amount of interest, and we are not just speaking to the usual names that everybody is chasing.'
p10717
aS'What are the usual names?'
p10718
aS'All large global banks and financial institutions.'
p10719
aS'I wont name them, but all those banks that are not present in India.'
p10720
aS'They have been called by almost everyone in the country.'
p10721
aS'We are trying to find entities that may be relatively small, but have done something in their home market that we can bring here.'
p10722
aS'Our objective is to find a set of people or organizations or institutions who can add value to the firm.'
p10723
aS'Who are you talking to in India?'
p10724
aS'We operate roughly in and around 659 cities and 2,200-odd locations.'
p10725
aS'We cover almost every segment of the marketmass affluent through our brokerage platform; SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and corporates through our investment bank.'
p10726
aS'One of the missing links is to go deep in rural penetration, which we dont have except our commodity business that operates roughly around 70-80 mandi offices.'
p10727
aS'We will be very open to partner with somebody who can give us the access to and understand the deep rural markets.'
p10728
aS'A microfinance institution (MFI)?'
p10729
aS'I dont know whether MFIs today cover the entire landscape of rural market and they really understand what is the rural banking need.'
p10730
aS'Consumer goods firms?'
p10731
aS'This is a right example.'
p10732
aS'Are your talking to Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd?'
p10733
aS'This market is wide open and probably they might be looking at doing this on their own.'
p10734
aS'But you are absolutely right.'
p10735
aS'We would be very open to partner with people who have experience and expertise in understanding the large rural market because knowledge is something that can only come when we create those partnerships.'
p10736
aS'Its very difficult to replicate.'
p10737
aS'How confident you are about getting the licence?'
p10738
aS'We should be seen as a strong contender for the banking business.'
p10739
aS'You have more than 10% exposure to broking business and this disqualifies you.'
p10740
aS'Well, its an interpretation.'
p10741
aS'More than the written words, if you go behind the intent of the guidelines, they have rightfully emphasized not on the entities, but on the promoter group.'
p10742
aS'For us, the promoter group is obviously two brothers, Malvinder and Shivinder, who own the majority of our company.'
p10743
aS'If you look at their group level revenue, the broking business is far less than 10%.'
p10744
aS'You are including healthcare and other businesses.'
p10745
aS'Yes, and the draft guidelines talk about the promoter group.'
p10746
aS'If we look at only Religare Enterprises, how much will be the broking business?'
p10747
aS'It will be around 13-14%.'
p10748
aS'In the draft guidelines, they also have made a comment that globally proprietary trading is being excluded or extracted from the banking business.'
p10749
aS'I think their worry is about those brokerages that have very significant proprietary trading that puts the risk of deposit holders money being used for proprietary trading and creating market risks.'
p10750
aS'The plain reading of the draft guidelines will not tell you the real intent behind them.'
p10751
aS'The concern is about the brokerage business that is exposed on the proprietary trading side.'
p10752
aS'The Singh family has much larger businesses than just Religare.'
p10753
aS'Your NBFC also has substantial exposure to capital market as you lend against shares.'
p10754
aS'Its not substantial.'
p10755
aS'Our NBFC is roughly around Rs.9,000 crore, of which the capital market business is around Rs.2,000-odd crore.'
p10756
aS'We are the only NBFC in the country that focuses on SMEs, the growth engine of the whole economy.'
p10757
aS'So you are eminently qualified to set up a bank.'
p10758
aS'We feel confident that we are among the strong contenders because of four main criteria that RBI has put and I will go beyond that.'
p10759
aS'The Singh family has the record of building successful businesses for three generations.'
p10760
aS'In the financial services world, other than Religare, there is no other entity that has so much of supervision of fiduciary businesses.'
p10761
aS'Today, we are regulated by all regulators in India.'
p10762
aS'We have business in 10 markets and are regulated by almost all regulators in the world.'
p10763
aS'We manage around $15 billion of assets not just in India, but in one of the most highly regulated market, the US.'
p10764
aS'Two years back, we got our parent company registered with RBI and our entire business is under its supervision and also the structure is exactly what the banking regulator wants.'
p10765
aS'Religare Enterprises is probably the only financial services company, or for that matter only company, where the family owning more than 70% doesnt sit on its board.'
p10766
aS'Majority of our board of directors are independent.'
p10767
aS'To qualify for a banking licence, you need to be widely held, but the Singh brothers hold 70%.'
p10768
aS'The draft guidelines talk about the promoter group level.'
p10769
aS'In fact, they want the non-operating company to be a wholly-owned subsidiary.'
p10770
aS'Ours is currently not a wholly-owned subsidiary, but held majority by them.'
p10771
aS'Second, a lot of our businesses have been in the incubation stage for sometime, which needs capital.'
p10772
aS'Diversification of Religare Enterprises shareholding is not difficult because our businesses require significant amount of capital for all our underlying subsidiaries.'
p10773
aS'The familys stake will continue to come down over a period of time and we will start raising more capital from the market.'
p10774
aS'Is arranging Rs 500 crore capital an issue?'
p10775
aS'I think the banking licence will generate so much of interest that capital wont be a problem for anyone.'
p10776
aS'Will you sell stake at a premium?'
p10777
aS'This business is not to get the shareholder value.'
p10778
aS'Fortunately for us, we have promoters who dont have capital constraint or capital problem and they want to generate significant value from their shareholding over a long period of time.'
p10779
aS'In some of our businesses, we have not asked for any premium.'
p10780
aS'In most life insurance ventures in India, the domestic partners have either taken an upfront premium, or have done something in which the foreign partner is not a partner but just an investor.'
p10781
aS'We have taken zero premium; we brought Aegon and made them partners and continue to build that business jointly.'
p10782
aS'If you get a banking licence, you would need to go to the market and list shares within two years.'
p10783
aS'What people have not probably read is that RBI has also said that existing businesses that these entities own and that can be done by the bank need to be consumed within the bank.'
p10784
aS'Technically, this means if we are running an NBFC, that needs to be converted or merged into the bank.'
p10785
aS'Since you will have a base of profitability and capital, I dont think two years is a problem.'
p10786
aS'Our NBFC generates significant profit for us and if we convert that as a bank or transfer its substantial assets to the new bank, within two years the bank can get listed.'
p10787
aS'Also, I think people underplay the institutional investors and their foresight.'
p10788
aS'RBI wants these firms to be listed so that their governance can be improved.'
p10789
aS'Two years is short time for sure, but its not so short that people wont understand and realize the value.'
p10790
aS'Also, this would restrain people from driving the business just for valuation because when you list in two years, you wont get the valuation.'
p10791
aS'I think RBI wants to constrain the incentive for building it around valuation.'

p10795
aS'The Bangalore-based company earned about 70% of its revenue of Rs 1,000 crore in 2010-11 by way of exports of solar photovoltaic panels, which convert light to electricity.'
p10796
aS'This year (2011-12), we expect 50% of our business to come from setting up grid connected projects in India, through the JNNSM or the state solar schemes, said chief executive K. Subramanya.'
p10797
aS'JNNSM, or the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, is Indias ambitious aim to increase the production of solar energy in the country to 1,000MW in 2013 and 20,000MW by 2022 from around 45MW now CHECK.'
p10798
aS'Tata BP Solar has been making solar-based lights for about two decades and exporting a majority of its panels.'
p10799
aS'Exports have been declining in part because of lower demand from Europe since January, but Subramanya attributes the shift in focus mainly to the companys strategy to capitalize on domestic government projects.'

aS'Each of these homes bear a solar panel of 40-75 watts, on an average, that can power two-four lights, a television and a fan.'
p10804
aS'We enable these homes to fund these projects by tying up with rural banks which provide them loans, Subramanya said.'
p10805
aS'The company has also executed street light projects for cities.'

aS'Its photovoltaic panel assembling unit in Banglaore has a capacity for 125MW a year but has so far only used about 70-75MW in any given year.'
p10807
aS'While the company expects production to remain the same in 2011-12, it sees volumes driven up over the years by the MW-sized installations that grid-connected projects from the national solar mission and state schemes will require.'
p10808
aS'Home lighting projects are typically watt-sized, and rooftop installations even on industrial units range between 4-10MW only, Subramanya said.'
p10809
aS'Tata BP Solar has bagged orders for 20MW in the first phase of the national solar mission and has orders for about 35MW of panels under state schemes.'

p10824
aS'The acquisition of Paras (in mid-December last year) had one strategic objective: to make a significant presence in health and personal care area in India, where we have been extremely strong only in the household portfolio.'
p10825
aS'What it has done is it has given us a strong foothold in the health sector with all pharmaceutical tradea reach to chemists, druggists, pharmaceuticals and hospitals.'
p10826
aS'Since we acquired Paras, we have already split the distribution channel and have a separate pharma channel in top 25 cities.'
p10827
aS'Secondly, we have just introduced Gaviscon in Tamil Naduan instant relief medicine for heartburn.'
p10828
aS'Its a unique pharma OTC product.'
p10829
aS'We have introduced it with medical reference test.'
p10830
aS'What about integrating employees?'
p10831
aS'The integration has been very very smooth.'
p10832
aS'Most employees wanted to stay with us; and they have stayed on.'
p10833
aS'Obviously, there were some synergies and even duplications.'
p10834
aS'A bulk is the sales force have been integrated.'
p10835
aS'Only 30 per cent of employees have had to find jobs elsewhere.'
p10836
aS'Are you going to focus on other brands as well to make them as big as Dettol (which does a busines of Rs 2,000 crore)?'
p10837
aS'Will this certain dependence on Dettol for the turnover go down in the future, with more of power brands coming in?'
p10838
aS'It would be absolutely right to say that Dettol comprise large part of our business.'
p10839
aS'Even so, generally what is not known is that we have other brands too in our portfolio that are performing exceptionally well  but are not talked about.'
p10840
aS'We have Harpic, which is by far the number one toilet cleaner, with 75 percent of the market share.'
p10841
aS'We have Lizola floor cleaner which has captured more than half the market space.'
p10842
aS'We have Cherry Polish, which is clearly the number one brand with a 70 per cent market share.'
p10843
aS'Then we have the leader Mortein (pest controller) in our portfolio too.'
p10844
aS'We have India as one of our strategic investment countries, and our overall portfolio will grow.'
p10845
aS'The ratio of Dettols share has to reduce but not its sales per se.'
p10846
aS'If Dettol sales slow down just because others are growing, then that will be the last thing we need.'
p10847
aS'How fast are you growing in India?'
p10848
aS'In the last four years, we are growing at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 40 per cent.'
p10849
aS'So the market is growing at 10 times the speed at which it was growing earlier.'
p10850
aS'For example, the household penetration for specialised toilet cleaners five years ago used to be less than 12 per cent.'
p10851
aS'Today, it is 21 per cent.'
p10852
aS'Already, the market is more than Rs 400 crore.'
p10853
aS'Do you see government policy changing ,so that you can sell the OTC pharma products not only in pharmacies but in grocery stores too?'
p10854
aS'There is strong proposal made to the government to allow these products to be sold at grocery stores also.'
p10855
aS'Strepsils, for example, is sold in pharmacies.'
p10856
aS'The question is, would you really worry about buying a Strepsil from a nearby grocer if its a clean and hygienic shop.'
p10857
aS'We will motivate the government to review the Act.'
p10858
aS'In the case of Reckitt, its brands are known more to consumers than the company.'
p10859
aS'Is that a drawback?'
p10860
aS'Are you relooking this strategy?'
p10861
aS'I think its a very interesting debate on whether it is better that people talk about the brand or the company.'
p10862
aS'It can go on for ever.'
p10863
aS'If you have a company that stands for Dettol, then it rubs off on everything.'
p10864
aS'In my view, there is also a danger that if something goes wrong with Dettol, then it goes wrong with everything.'
p10865
aS'However, what you are saying is right.'
p10866
aS'We have internally debated this for some years now.'
p10867
aS'We have actually taken two countries where are promoting companys name rather than just brands  Germany and Brazil.'
p10868
aS'Once we see the impact, we will take it further.'
p10869
aS'You have now gone quite aggressively in the management campus.'
p10870
aS'Is India becoming a global hunting ground for the company?'
p10871
aS'India is certainly identified as one of the key countries for providing global talent.'
p10872
aS'Earlier, we were recruiting 4-5 management trainees a year.'
p10873
aS'Now, we are recruiting 15 and more of them.'
p10874
aS'Earlier, we were taking only sales and marketing management trainees; now we are taking trainees for the supply chain, HR, finance.'
p10875
aS'So, its now broad-based.'
p10876
aS'Everybody in India is grappling today with the challenges of addressing the pyramid concept and basically looking at how to address the challenge of rural markets.'
p10877
aS'How do you do it?'
p10878
aS'A key challenge is to be able to understand the right price and value.'
p10879
aS'In RB, we have launched Veet hair remover, in 25-gm tubes.'
p10880
aS'It is quite popular in semi-urban and smaller towns.'
p10881
aS'In fact, the penetration of these tubes in smaller towns is almost half of that in metros.'
p10882
aS'However, earlier it was priced at Rs 40 for a bigger pack.'
p10883
aS'Another example: the 200-ml bottle of Harpic has a distribution of more than 450,000 in these smaller towns.'
p10884
aS'We introduced Dettol soaps in 35-gm packs in smaller towns.'
p10885
aS'It has worked.'
p10886
aS'But to address this market, do you have to create a different distribution system?'
p10887
aS'Yes.'
p10888
aS'See, there is something known as a hub-and-spoke model.'
p10889
aS'Effectively, it means that RB goes to 3000 towns for distribution.'
p10890
aS'We have distributors who are supplied from these locations; they supply into smaller towns they cover.'
p10891
aS'They then supply to their wholesale channels.'
p10892
aS'For example, soaps are sold in 23 lakh outlets.'
p10893
aS'There are challenges of profitability, but I think the consumer will graduate upwards as the income grows.'
p10894
aS'One major criticism that comes to you when you bought is that you overpaid for Paras?'
p10895
aS'RB makes strategic acquisitions.'
p10896
aS'For example, we bought Boots healthcare, Strepsils and Nurofen out of that.'
p10897
aS'We have doubled the growth rates of business of what Bootss.'
p10898
aS'The right price depends on the strategic imperatives and how big do you see the map.'
p10899
aS'We think it is the best pharma purchase in this country.'
p10900
aS'Time will show whether we are able to move the pharma Paras brands to the pace that we are used to.'
p10901
aS'That is quite significant.'
p10902
aS'The Rs 110-crore UFO Moviez recently took a majority stake in Scrabble Entertainment, the only aggregator of screens in India that are compliant with the digital cinema initiative  a standard developed by the six big Hollywood studios.'
p10903
aS'UFO Moviez is one of the largest digital cinema companies in India with its 2,500 digital screens in 1,300 cities and having a total capacity of 1.3 million seats.'
p10904
aS'Kapil Agarwal, the companys joint managing director, tells Vanita Kohli-Khandekar what the acquisition means to UFOs growth and top line.'
p10905
aS'Edited excerpts:\nYou have been such proponents of the satellite-based MPEG4 technology.'
p10906
aS'Why invest in Scrabble and DCI then?'
p10907
aS'The key issue in the delivery of films in India is logistics.'
p10908
aS'So we were very clear that we should be able to deliver irrespective of weather, transport or road conditions.'
p10909
aS'But with MPEG2 the file size of a film could only go from 3 terabytes to 60-80 gigabytes.'
p10910
aS'So we werent managing to optimise the use of satellite bandwidth.'
p10911
aS'Remember, this was in 2002-03, when satellite bandwidth was very expensive.'
p10912
aS'Hollywood did not have access to MPEG4 so DCI was designed around MPEG2.'
p10913
aS'As luck would have it, the company that developed the MPEG4 standard for films went bust.'
p10914
aS'So we acquired it and the encoders.'
p10915
aS'That is how we ended up using MPEG4 cost effectively.'
p10916
aS'Hollywood has typically been less than 10 per cent of the revenues of the film business in India.'
p10917
aS'And in 2005, the DCI-compliant system cost Rs 50 lakh-60 lakh.'
p10918
aS'In a market with ticket prices averaging between Rs 10-50, there is no way DCI standards will take off in India.'
p10919
aS'So now we have UFO for emerging markets with a strong local content industry, like Indonesia and Korea.'
p10920
aS'We bought Scrabble, for mature markets, more dependent on Hollywood fare.'
p10921
aS'What has the pattern on average ticket prices, occupancy and viewership been in the towns where you have digital screens?'
p10922
aS'Typically capacity utilisation has jumped from 10 per cent to 50-60 per cent, revenues have jumped, and so have ticket prices.'
p10923
aS'A jump of anywhere between 50-100 per cent is normal.'
p10924
aS'So, where ticket prices were at Rs 15, they have gone to Rs 50 and 60 too.'
p10925
aS'How has your revenue composition changed?'
p10926
aS'In FY 2010, we got less than 15 per cent of our revenues from advertising.'
p10927
aS'In FY 2012, we will get close to 45-50 per cent from advertising.'
p10928
aS'We now do business with every major advertiser: Group M, Hindustan Unilever HUL.'

p10936
aS"The rating downgrade could potentially have some impact on SBI's overseas borrowings, but these are just about five per cent of the total liabilities and to that extent, we see limited impact on overall cost of funds, they added."
p10937
aS'Analysts at ICICIdirect, an online broking arm of ICICI Securities, expect SBIs near-term cost of funds to rise, particularly overseas borrowing rates.'

aS'Why should they have perched access to only one product...There is no question that we as the last mile players need to connect with banks.'

aS'Bankers said it is a misconception that innovation led to a crisis in the global financial system.'
p11360
aS'What happened in 2008 was the lack of transparency and faulty regulations around those products, which allowed an over-concentration of risk.'

aS'And it was more the lack of transparency than the innovation itself," Rich Ricci, co-chief executive of Barclays Capital, United Kingdom, said.'
p11362
aS'Kapoor said there was a need to strengthen the regulatory inspection on innovative financial products.'
p11363

p11373
aS'Nirav Panchmatia, founder and director, AUM financial advisors, says: "Despite the deregulation of savings account interest rates and high rates offered by FDs, returns from debt funds continue to be more attractive on a post-tax basis."'
p11374
aS'The interest earned from savings accounts  in post office, banks as well as short-term FDs  is added to your income and taxed according to slab, at 30 per cent if you fall in the highest tax bracket.'
p11375
aS'Returns from liquid funds, if you opt for the dividend payout option, are net of distribution tax, levied at 13.5 per cent (borne by the fund house).'
p11376
aS'Otherwise, capital gains on debt funds are taxed at 10 per cent and 20 per cent, with and without indexation, respectively.'
p11377
aS'However, the tax advantage may not be reason enough for an individual to give preference to debt.'

aS'For instance, in case of debt funds, if a redemption request is put before 3 pm on any day, the funds would be transferred the next day.'
p11384
aS'If it is put in after 3 pm, the request is processed the next day and the funds are credited the day after.'
p11385
aS'For short-term deposits, the funds would be accessible only after two-three working days of putting a request to break an FD.'

p11387
aS'So, bank customers have little incentive for shifting to post office savings accounts.'
p11388
aS'The reverse, too, is improbable, according to Malhar Majumder, a certified financial planner.'
p11389
aS'"The minimum balance requirement and charges levied by private sector banks that have raised the savings rates currently will be a deterrent for PO customers, usually maintaining small balances."'
p11390
aS'The returns from debt instruments may soon start falling, as expectations of a reversal in the interest rate cycle are rife.'
p11391
aS'And, when that happens, with the mandatory four per cent return requirement being done away with, savings account rates can dip even beyond this.'
p11392
aS"Yet, irrespective of returns offered, Majumder feels that from a financial planning viewpoint, individuals should maintain a balance equivalent to three-six months' expenses in a savings account for contingency planning."
p11393
aS'Here, liquidity must gain prominence over returns.'
p11394
aS'Excess funds, possibly attached to short-term goals, say, with an investment horizon of three months to a year, can be deployed in either short-term deposits or debt funds.'

p12104
aS'At 142-million TV homes, over 650 channels and Rs 33,000 crore in revenues, the Indian television industry is big.'
p12105
aS'Even if 300 channels are buying 6-8 hours of fresh programming a day, the numbers are huge.'
p12106

aS'Clearly then Vikatan and Co are doing something right.'
p12113
aS'What is it?'
p12114
aS'How it works \r\nTo figure that out, it is important to know two things.'
p12115
aS'One, the making and selling of television content to broadcasters remains a fragmented business with an estimated 6,000 producers, all willing to do it at a price less than the earlier guy.'
p12116
aS'It is next to impossible to sustain value growth.'
p12117
aS'Even Balaji has seen erosion with revenues halving over the last five years.'
p12118
aS'Now, add the fact that both costs and revenues have been hit.'
p12119
aS'The cost of making a 30-minute show could range from Rs 75,000 to a crore depending on language, genre (fiction/non-fiction), broadcaster and so on.'
p12120
aS'These have doubled over the last three years as talent costs have increased.'
p12121
aS'On the other hand, revenues in broadcasting overall have grown slowly.'
p12122
aS'So, the rates paid to production companies havent increased significantly.'
p12123
aS'We work on very thin margins, says S K Barua, managing director, Fremantle Media.'
p12124
aS'Two, a bulk  about 70 per cent  of the programming created is commissioned.'
p12125
aS'The broadcaster retains the IPR (Intellectual Property Right).'
p12126
aS'The remaining 30 per cent of the programming created in India is made on a telecast fee or a sponsored model.'
p12127
aS'This means the broadcaster leases airtime, say a half hour slot, to the producer.'
p12128
aS'The producer then makes the show, sells the advertising time on it and tries to recover the money he paid plus make a profit.'
p12129
aS'In this case, the IPR rests with the producer.'
p12130
aS'Roughly half of Sun TVs programming and all of Doordarshans is based on this.'
p12131
aS'The ownership of IPR and the freedom to trade in them is key to helping content industries scale up, say experts.'
p12132
aS'In the UK, for instance, a 2004 change in trade regulations ensured that IPR is retained by the firm that makes the shows, not the broadcaster.'
p12133
aS'This was a turning point of sorts.'
p12134
aS'As a result production companies such as Fremantle Media or Shine (Masterchef, Got to Dance) became very aggressive about creating exportable formats and scaling up.'
p12135
aS'Inching up\r\nThe Network18 group got out of television production ten years ago.'

p12157
aS'That would put its revenues at somewhere between Rs 60-80 crore, though Sharma declines to share the number.'
p12158
aS'The second reason scale is getting a chance is because the nature of the demand is shifting from daily soap kind of shows to more specialised ones on food, lifestyle or travel, says Karan Ahluwalia, executive vice-president and country head, media and entertainment banking group, Yes Bank.'

aS'Then there is the unstated growth, which all of us tend to forget.'
p12220
aS'About consumer confidence, recently I spent 15 days in smaller towns and villages.'
p12221
aS'There you find nobody exhibiting a negative mood to the extent we see in urban centres.'

p12227
aS'Today, Indian banks have various growth drivers.'
p12228
aS'There are growth opportunities in the corporate and retail sectors.'
p12229
aS'Then there is the government and the farm sector.'
p12230
aS'I guess once we are back on the growth path, 20 per cent growth in assets will be possible.'
p12231
aS'How confident are you about the earnings growth of Indian companies in the coming quarters?'
p12232
aS'If we do a performance check of corporate India, we will see that in the last quarter, growth in profitability has indeed come down from 17 per cent to 13 per cent.'
p12233
aS'This was caused by higher raw material and labour costs, along with an increase in interest rates.'
p12234
aS'But, I think the top line still increased at a healthy rate and the growth remains positive.'
p12235
aS'So far, corporate Indias overall performance does not signal any kind of fear.'
p12236
aS'The manufacturing sector is in self-financing mode to a large extent and doesnt need term financing at this point of time.'

aS'The services sector is still doing well.'
p12238
aS'We had a better monsoon and the rural sector appears stable.'
p12239
aS'So, what is causing this negativity in sentiments?'
p12240
aS'I think in the minds of corporate India what is enveloping this gloom and negativity is the situation with the stock market.'
p12241
aS'My feeling is only 20-25 per cent investments, that were ought to happen, probably were throttled.'
p12242
aS'But the impact on the feel-good sentiment is disproportionate, probably 50-60 per cent.'
p12243
aS'The stock market is at a level that is not giving corporates any leeway to do things that are needed.'
p12244
aS'It is virtually breaking the back of corporate India.'
p12245
aS'I think once the economic numbers look up following a correction in the inflation level and drop in interest rates, the market will provide access to entrepreneurs to move and raise funds.'
p12246
aS'Only then will we see the same level of the animal spirit that all of us want to see.'
p12247
aS'Currently, the animal spirit is lacking.'
p12248
aS'What is needed to improve sentiments?'
p12249
aS'Sentiments are based on three factors.'
p12250
aS'The first is the state of the economy, inflation and interest rates.'
p12251
aS'Next comes policy action and the third is market conditions.'
p12252
aS'In a way, all these factors are linked.'
p12253
aS'If you set the right interest rate and ease inflation, the capital market will improve.'
p12254
aS'We need to ask ourselves if the Indian market deserves to be one of the worst performers when the economy is still growing at a seven per cent-plus rate?'
p12255
aS'It means we have overreacted to the situation.'
p12256
aS'The government needs to speak up and say things are actually not as bad as they are made out to be.'
p12257
aS'They need to demonstrate their willingness to push reforms.'
p12258
aS'Along with this, policy action on interest rates will trigger some momentum in the market.'
p12259
aS'Which are the sectors that concern you?'
p12260
aS'The only thing that can upset the points I have made so far is infrastructure.'
p12261
aS'It can be a game-stopper.'
p12262
aS'There are three sectors that can cause some worry going forward.'
p12263
aS'If no action is taken immediately, the power sector can be a concern in the next 12-18 months.'
p12264
aS'We should be prepared to pay higher cost per unit of power because the costs of coal, land, etc have gone up.'
p12265
aS'From a regulatory perspective, we need to respond quickly, understand, analyse and decide quickly whether to allow a higher cost per unit of power.'
p12266
aS'This is the single biggest worry at this point.'
p12267
aS'The other two areas are land acquisition and environment.'
p12268
aS'What is your outlook on the rupee?'
p12269
aS'I was surprised by the way the rupee weakened.'
p12270
aS'At 44, we may have appeared overvalued but the rapidity with which it moved to 47-48 and then further to 53-54 was surprising.'
p12271
aS'It depreciated almost 20 per cent in less than a quarter.'
p12272
aS'It was clearly a reaction to the capital market and adverse news globally.'
p12273
aS'But, I think the exchange rate will reverse in the near term, and the next stop is around 48.'
p12274
aS'Again, I ask myself the question if the economy is growing at seven per cent then does it make sense for such a sharp depreciation in the rupee within a short period?'
p12275
aS'Im struggling to find a rationale.'
p12276
aS'How do you see the stress on banks asset quality in this environment?'
p12277
aS'I dont think from a systemic context, the stress in banks balance sheets now is anywhere near the situation we had earlier.'
p12278
aS'Most of the stress is caused by an imbalance in interest rate or debts.'
p12279
aS'Once you correct that imbalance, the stress is relieved.'
p12280
aS'History has shown that restructured assets in India come back fairly intact.'
p12281
aS'I dont think anyone is currently talking about stress in the quality of loans to manufacturing companies.'
p12282
aS'So, I think the fears are somewhat overstated.'
p12283
aS'While financial health issues for reasons like leveraging and interest rates have to be addressed, I dont think the current environment will cripple banks or their borrowers.'
p12284
aS'Do you think the Reserve Bank effected too many rate hikes and that led to this slowdown in credit demand?'
p12285
aS'The central bank was going through a cycle where almost double-digit inflation was staring it in the face.'
p12286
aS'Despite the rate hikes, inflation was just not responding.'
p12287
aS'So, it had to give what is conventional medicine.'
p12288
aS'We should not speculate whether it worked or not but I guess the central bank had no other option but to increase rates.'
p12289
aS'Now, as we see inflation easing, corrective steps on interest rates can be taken.'
p12290
aS'Are Indian banks looking to acquire some of the loan exposure of European banks in India?'
p12291
aS'If the pricing is right, the rating is right, then why not?'
p12292
aS'The risk-reward equation has to be correct and Im sure Indian banks will look at this opportunity.'
p12293
aS'We believe we understand Indian risks better and have the capacity to absorb those risks.'
p12294
aS'The state power utility, APGenco, on Friday commissioned a 1-Mw solar photovoltaic power plant, which it had installed at the Jurala hydro-electric project in Mahabubnagar district .'
p12295
aS'The plant was synchronised with the grid today and it will start commercial operations from tomorrow, said K Vijayanand, managing director of APGenco, in a press release.'
p12296
aS'The plant was set up at a cost of Rs 12.8 crore and was designed to generate 1.4 million units of power a year, according to the press release.'

aS'The project was allocated to the power utility under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission.'
p12298
aS'A cap on borrowing by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) from banks may strengthen the financial system.'
p12299
aS'According to a study by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), non-deposit taking NBFCs would lead to more systemic risks, owing to their reliance on banks for funding needs.'
p12300
aS'As a policy, when NBFCs are discouraged from raising public deposits, these become non-deposit taking, while increasingly substituting public deposits with borrowings from the banking system, the working paper said.'
p12301
aS'Hence, there seems to be scope to fix a separate ceiling for ND (non-deposit taking) NBFCs to borrow from the banking system, the study added.'
p12302
aS'Non-banking financial companies heavily depend on banks for meeting their funding needs, as many of these are not allowed to raise deposits.'
p12303
aS'However, by borrowing through banks, these indirectly use public deposits, on a much larger scale than by raising deposits on their own.'
p12304
aS'The study also said due to high inter-connectedness, the vulnerability of the financial system may increase due to high inter-dependability.'
p12305
aS'There is a possibility that chains of inter-connectedness can make the system more vulnerable to shocks in any market, or at any single larger institution, the RBI working paper said.'
p12306
aS'While both banks and NBFCs would be impacted if either of these sectors are hit, the impact on NBFCs would be much greater.'
p12307
aS'Even at the slightest symptom of a crisis or a crisis-like situation, NBFCs can face pressure of withdrawal from banks, similar to the one encountered from mutual funds immediately after the Lehman Brothers episode, the study said.'
p12308
aS'Also, with tighter capital adequacy norms, banks may lend less or may completely stop lending to the sector in extreme cases.'
p12309
aS'Banks may either become too reluctant to lend to NBFCs or in an extreme case, these may completely refrain from lending to NBFCs, which would further precipitate the situation.'
p12310
aS'Any strain in the normal chain would compel NBFCs to turn to the money market with higher costs to wade over the tight liquidity conditions, thus disturbing the money market as well, the paper said.'
p12311
aS'Apart from suggesting a cap on the borrowing limit of ND-NBFCs from banks, the working paper also suggested NBFCs should diversify their sources of funds.'
p12312
aS'NBFCs future growth depends, to a large extent, on the success these achieve in diversification of sources of funds, it said.'

p12318
aS'This, according to KECs managing director and chief executive officer Ramesh Chandak, is the second order in two weeks placed with his firm by Haldia Energy Ltd, a CESC unit setting up a power plant at West Bengals port town of Haldia.'

aS'KEC has received a mandate from Haldia Energy to install a transmission cable across the Hooghly river spanning some 3km, strung up on a 246-metre tower.'

aS'There is nothing unusual in this, said a spokesperson for Sanjiv Goenkas RP-Sanjiv Goenka group.'
p12322
aS'The separation of business interests was concluded amicably and the two brothers would continue to deal with each other commercially, he added.'
p12323
aS'In an earlier interview, Sanjiv Goenka had said companies within the undivided RPG Group have always dealt with each other strictly on commercial terms, and that they would continue to do so even after the companies were divided between him and his brother.'
p12324
aS'KEC had secured this order from CESC through a competitive bidding process, where other companies had participated as well.'

p13632
aS'"The official procedures for procuring both the land were completed and the proposal would soon be submitted to the Central government," Dhole said, adding that the project might be cleared in six months\' time.'
p13633
aS'As per the norms, the land should be non-productive and of non-interference from the villagers in its vicinity and the average temperature must be at 31 degree Celsius and no felling of trees allowed.'
p13634
aS'The identified land suits the bill, he said.'
p13635
aS'The MahaGenco will have to pay a compensation of Rs 8 lakh per hectare to the forest department besides an equal quantum of productive land against the 700 hectares forest land ceded to MahaGenco, Dhole said.'

aS'The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today issued a notification to reduce the bank rate or the interest the banks and financial institutions pay to the central bank on borrowed funds to 9% from 9.5% now.'
p13638
aS'"The RBI has decided to lower the bank rate to 9% per annum from 9.5% per annum with effect from April 17, 2012," the central bank said in a statement.'
p13639
aS'The notification follows the announcement made by RBI Governor D Subbarao in the annual credit policy which was unveiled yesterday.'
p13640
aS'In line with 0.5% cut in short-term lending (repo) rate, the RBI also reduced the bank rate to 9%.'
p13641
aS'The RBI decided to reduce the benchmark repo rate to 8% from 8.5%, after a gap of three years, to promote growth which during 2011-12, which slipped to a three year low of 6.9%.'
p13642
aS'The central bank has pegged the GDP growth rate for the current fiscal at 7.3%.'
p13643
aS'There is an expectation among many that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) would cut the repo rate (at which it lends to banks) by 25 basis points in its annual policy review meeting scheduled on Tuesday, to boost growth in the economy.'
p13644
aS'After increasing the policy rate 13 times between March 2010 and October 2011, to 8.5 per cent, the central bank made no change in its last two policy reviews.'
p13645
aS'Quite a few economists and market participants believe the high global oil prices may act as a deterrent for a rate cut, but, the cost of not cutting is also rapidly rising.'
p13646
aS'reflected, for instance, in slowing economic activity.'
p13647
aS'Todays weak IIP (Index of Industrial Production) data, along with lower core inflation, should cement the case for a rate cut, as the cost of not cutting rates is rising.'
p13648
aS'We expect a 25-bps repo rate cut and no change in the Cash Reserve Ratio (the portion of their reserves banks must keep instead of lending) on April 17, said economists Sonal Verma and Aman Mohunta of Nomura Securities.'
p13649
aS'Factory output data for February was 4.1 per cent, lower than the consensus estimate.'
p13650
aS'The trend in recent months suggested interest rate-sensitive consumer durables goods output growth had fallen sharply.'
p13651
aS'Economists expect March industrial production data to also be weak.'
p13652
aS'Overall, we think growth momentum in the economy is weak, though not as weak as in the last quarter of 2011...we think RBI will be willing to support growth by cutting the repo rate by 25-bps in the coming monetary policy meeting, unless the March inflation number surprises sharply to the upside, said Taimur Baig and Kaushik Das, economists with Deutsche Bank.'
p13653
aS'The inflation figures for March, to be released a day before the policy meet, would be a key input for the central banks decision.'
p13654
aS'The market is expecting slightly lower inflation in March, but core or non-food manufacturing inflation could see a sharp decline.'
p13655
aS'Treasury officials said the bond market had factored in a 25-bps rate cut, as yields on government paper fell sharply on Thursday following the poor IIP numbers.'
p13656
aS'Yield on the 10-year benchmark government paper closed at 8.44 per cent, about 11-bps lower than yesterdays close.'
p13657
aS'Bond markets have discounted a 25bps rate cut in the annual policy because of poor industrial production numbers.'
p13658
aS'So, markets are expecting RBI to cut rates to support growth, said T S Srinivasan, general manager-treasury at Indian Overseas Bank.'
p13659
aS'He added the uncertainty on the government being able to reign in the fiscal deficit might limit RBIs comfort in starting the monetary easing cycle.'
p13660
aS'During its mid-quarter review, RBI had said a credible plan for fiscal consolidation was essential to have lower inflation.'
p13661
aS'The inflation risks are legitimate and in our opinion, should be an important factor in determining essentially the magnitude of rate cuts by RBI.'
p13662
aS'As such, we expect RBI to ease rates by 50-75 bps in FY13, said a YES Bank note, adding that a weak outlook on growth warranted commencing of monetary easing, by cutting the policy rate 25 bps on Tuesday.'
p13663
aS'Market participants, however, are ruling out a cut in CRR, as liquidity has improved in April.'
p13664
aS'This is reflected in lower borrowing from RBIs repo facility.'
p13665
aS'CRR was reduced by 125 bps to 4.75 per cent since January, to ease tightness.'
p13666
aS'Banks daily borrowing has fallen from about Rs 2 lakh crore in March to Rs 80,000 crore-1 lakh crore in the current fortnight.'
p13667
aS'The overnight call money rates have eased from around 10 per cent to nine per cent in the same period.'
p13668
aS'Market participants said government spending in the form of bond redemptions helped in easing the liquidity pressures.'
p13669
aS'In the first week of April, about Rs 27,000 crore of inflows came as the government redeemed maturing bonds.'

aS'NEW DELHI: After TOI exposed the lacunae in the banking and retail system when it comes to shopping with debit cards, we look at a slew of measures that the  Reserve Bank of India is in the midst of putting in place in a bid to make both credit cards and debit cards safer to shop with.'
p13672
aS"A couple of months ago, two TOI reporters swapped debit cards and shopped at four popular stores at Connaught Place using each other's card."
p13673
aS'"We are aware of the issue that you (TOI) have pointed out.'
p13674
aS"That's why we issue guidelines for banks on security and risk mitigation measures for Card Present Transactions (transactions where the card is physically present, unlike online transactions)."
p13675
aS'The guidelines issued in 2011 have a clear roadmap for moving towards more secure ways of credit/debit card transactions ultimately through Aadhar-based biometric authentication," says RBI  spokesperson Alpana Killawala.'
p13676
aS'If the biometric data collected during the Nandan Nilekani-led Unique Identity programme is used for card transactions, a customer shopping with a credit/debit card will have his fingerprints scanned before a transaction is allowed to go through.'
p13677
aS'The fingerprints will be matched with the ones stored in the  Aadhar data bank.'
p13678
aS'Currently, the total industry lost, stolen and counterfeit card fraud is Rs 13 crore.'
p13679
aS'In mid- 2011, RBI came out with a report on securing Card Present Transactions.'
p13680
aS'The RBI has issued a circular based on the report which states that by June 2013, all Point of Sales machines (used to swipe debit/credit cards at shops) must have the infrastructure to support transactions made with a pin typed into the machine.'
p13681
aS'This provides an additional layer of security against stolen cards being swiped at shops.'
p13682
aS'Currently, the signature at the back of the card is the only safeguard against a stolen card being misused at retail outlets.'
p13683
aS'But as TOI discovered, merchants rarely tally the signature on the card and the receipt.'
p13684
aS'In the short term, the RBI is looking at introducing a pin as an additional layer of security against stolen cards.'
p13685
aS"But the bank is also working towards an alternative to the current magnetic strip on the back of the card, which stores a customer's bank account data and is susceptible to 'skimming' whereby rogue machines can copy the data on the card."
p13686
aS'Hence several countries across the globe, including Malaysia, UK and European countries use an EMV chip__a smart chip on which data is stored inside the card__instead of the magnetic strip used in countries such as India, US and China.'
p13687
aS'The EMV chip, coupled with a pin, is a more secure system when compared with the magnetic strip.'
p13688
aS'While RBI currently aims at moving to a system of using biometric (Aadhar-based) data along with the magnetic strip in order to secure the card, if this fails to take off, RBI wants India to migrate to using the EMV chip-based system along with a pin.'
p13689
aS'Banks have started raising the interest rates on foreign currency non-resident (banks) deposits (FCNR-B) after the Reserve Bank of India raised the ceiling on these deposits to attract foreign inflows from non-resident Indians (NRIs).'
p13690
aS'The revised rates for one year to less than two years for dollars deposits is 3.05 per cent, compared with 2.30 per cent earlier.'
p13691
aS'For five years, the maturity bracket the new rate is 4.11 per cent, against the old rate of 2.36 per cent, State Bank of India (SBI) said in a statement.'
p13692
aS'The central bank had, on Friday, raised the ceiling from 125 basis points (bps) to 200 bps above the corresponding London interbank offered rate/swap rates for deposits with maturities of one year to less than three years.'
p13693
aS'For deposits of three-five years, the maturity ceiling has been raised to 300 bps from 125 bps.'
p13694
aS'Senior SBI official said the change was driven by need to bring in stable foreign money.'
p13695
aS'NRIs, especially blue collar and information technology professionals, who are retail customers are expected to respond the most to these rate revisions.'
p13696
aS'SBIs outstanding NRI deposit base is about $11 billion.'

p13703
aS'Zoellick, who is stepping down as president on June 30, visited the banks office in Chennai, which has grown from about 70 staff in 2001 to close to 500 staff on Friday, providing corporate, financial, accounting, administrative and IT services to its operations around the globe.'
p13704
aS'The Chennai office reflects the banks commitment to decentralising business processes while enhancing our global presence.'
p13705
aS'Its a clear demonstration of the banks continuing efforts to use resources effectively to deliver development results on the ground, Zoellick said in a statement.'
p13706

p13714
aS'In order to comply with KYC requirements of correct address of the person, fresh address proof may be obtained upon such transfer by the transferee branch, it said.'
p13715
aS'RBI said: "It has been brought to our notice that some banks are insisting on opening of fresh accounts by customers when customers approach them for transferring their account from one branch of the bank to another branch of the same bank.'
p13716
aS'"Such insistence on opening of fresh account or making the customer undergo full KYC process again causes inconvenience to them resulting in poor customer service," it said.'
p13717
aS'"It is not reasonable in view of the fact that most bank branches are now on Core Banking Service [CBS] and KYC records of a particular customer can be accessed by any branch of the bank," it said.'

aS'Mumbai: Reserve Bank of Indias deputy governor Anand Sinha, who holds the critical portfolio of banking and non-banking regulations and has been busy drafting new bank-licensing norms, said in an interview on Friday that non-performing assets of the banking system have almost bottomed out.'
p13719
aS'By his estimate, at the worst about 20% of the restructured assets in the banking system can turn bad.'
p13720
aS'Sinha also said the central bank is well prepared with the new bank licensing rules that can be released as soon as Parliament amends the banking law and empowers the regulator to supersede a banks board.'
p13721
aS'Edited excerpts:\nThe cabinet has approved the amendment to banking regulations laws.'
p13722
aS'This will give you the power to supersede a banks board, which you have been demanding as a precondition to allowing corporate houses entry into banking.'
p13723
aS'When will we see the new banks?'
p13724
aS'I suppose this will have to be approved by Parliament.'
p13725
aS'We will have to wait for that and see in what format it comes, because in our draft guidelines, we had written very clearly that we will finalize the guidelines after we see the amendment.'
p13726
aS'It is very difficult for me to say how long it will take because this is a legislative process.'
p13727
aS'If it happens in this session (of Parliament), then we are geared up to move quite fast.'
p13728
aS'We will have an external committee which will be looking into the applications for evaluation.'
p13729
aS'Managing transitions: Sinha says there is a lot of misconception and negativity about restructuring of loans.'
p13730
aS'Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint\nWhy are you insisting on amending the law?'
p13731
aS'We are venturing into a completely new area, and even in the past, we have felt handicapped because of our lack of power to supersede the boards.'
p13732
aS'Consolidated supervision is another very important area, particularly when you are dealing with complex groups.'
p13733
aS'It is absolutely essential for us to have these powers to move forward.'
p13734
aS'In the December quarter, the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of Indian banks were 2.9%.'
p13735
aS'Experts say these could go up to 3.5% in the next one year.'
p13736
aS'Whats your estimate?'
p13737
aS'Its a fact that NPAs have been increasing and it couldnt be otherwise.'
p13738
aS'Look at the stress in the Indian economy and NPAs are only a reflection of that.'
p13739
aS'We should also remember one more thing that NPA is composed of two parts.'
p13740
aS'One is what slips into NPA and the other is what you recover.'
p13741
aS'In a stress situation, both are inversely correlatedthe slippage increases and the recovery gets depressed.'
p13742
aS'It is the difference between the two which is leading to increase in NPAs.'
p13743
aS'Wacth Video\nAnand Sinha talks about the state of the microfinance industry and whether he believes the problem of bad loans in Indias banks is going to get worse.'
p13744
aS'Loading Video...\nWhat is the real issue?'
p13745
aS'The real issue is that while we have to accept that the NPAs have increased, we have to also learn to manage them well, in the sense that we have to be more proactive in our credit monitoring system.'
p13746
aS'Ahead of the policy meeting, when we met NBFCs (non-banking financial companies), they were all very emphatic that their asset quality is very good and they are hands on in managing...'
p13747
aS'I take something from this...'
p13748
aS'So bankers are not hands-on?'
p13749
aS'I wont say that but you can always improve.'
p13750
aS'All I am trying to say is that given the economic situation, NPAs have risen... We have to make more efforts in monitoring the accounts and that is where the issue of restructuring comes.'
p13751
aS'We are keeping a close watch but it is difficult for me to say whether it will become worse.'
p13752
aS'It may go down a little bit.'
p13753
aS'I would expect that it should have bottomed out now...'
p13754
aS'If you look at the world economy, in the US there are signs of the economy improving...'
p13755
aS'In our own economy, despite the potential upside risk, inflation has subsided now and there has been a rate cut.'
p13756
aS'Taking all these things into account, I would expect that NPAs should have bottomed out.'
p13757
aS'Are the numbers real or you see banks fudging?'
p13758
aS'With so much of oversight with system-generated NPAs, I would hope that the figures are real or very close to real.'
p13759
aS'There was a time when there used to be huge differences between the NPA estimate done by the banks as certified by their statutory auditors and as that would come out in our AFIs (annual financial inspections).'
p13760
aS'Thats very much controlled now.'
p13761
aS'Are banks suppressing their NPAs by restructuring loans?'
p13762
aS'One estimate says that by 2013 there will be Rs 2 trillion worth of restructured loans.'
p13763
aS'There is a lot of misconception and negativity about restructuring.'
p13764
aS'How do you manage your advances portfolio?'
p13765
aS'You have to be proactive in monitoring and should not let the assets slip into potentially weak categories.'
p13766
aS'Despite your best efforts, it may happen because of the environment.'
p13767
aS'Now, if an account is under stress, you have only two optionseither you call back your advance, which will be very injurious to the economy, and if that account is viable, potentially with a little handholding, it can come out of the stress.'
p13768
aS'Restructuring is a very important tool in managing advances portfolio.'
p13769
aS'Isnt this tool being misused by some banks?'
p13770
aS'There are apprehensions.'
p13771
aS'Restructuring certainly is an indicator of stress in the system... \nSomething as fundamental as an NPA is not measured in a uniform manner across the world, and similarly, the ways to deal with restructured accounts also vary...'
p13772
aS'If you look at the West, they dont automatically downgrade an asset.'
p13773
aS'If there is a conviction that the restructured loans would come back and the loss in the fair value is provided forwhich we also dothe accounts remain standard.'
p13774
aS'So you are not worried.'
p13775
aS'We are not worried, but at the same time I can tell you that we have set up a committee to look into this whole issue.'
p13776
aS'How much of the restructured assets can go bad?'
p13777
aS'Anecdotal evidence shows that roughly 15% of such loans do slip.'
p13778
aS'In some banks, it may be much lower, but overall, this is our sense.'
p13779
aS'Even if you take an outer limit of 20%, still 80% will remain standard.'
p13780
aS'So you have two optionseither 100% of the restructured standard advances in the year of restructuring you add to NPAs and next year you take out 80% of that back to standard asset, or you keep 100% as standard and next year you downgrade 20% or 15%.'
p13781
aS'The base rate, or the minimum lending rate of a bank, is supposed to be more scientific and transparent but its not so.'
p13782
aS'The base rate is ultimately linked to your cost of whatever anchor that you have...'
p13783
aS'I would expect that if the banks are changing or not changing the base rate, they have to demonstrate as to what has happened because of which the base rate has either remained the same or changed.'
p13784
aS'As far as the spread is concerned, it has got certain components.'
p13785
aS'The spread should also change scientifically.'
p13786
aS'Most banks do not give the benefit to the old customers when they cut the loan rate.'
p13787
aS'I am aware of the fact that there are customer issues, distinction between customers.'
p13788
aS'There is a committee under me which is looking into these issues.'
p13789
aS'The banks have their own points and we have to listen to them; we have to find out why they are doing it.'
p13790
aS'Purely from logical and theoretical perspective, one would expect that the spread should not change if the credit quality doesnt change.'
p13791
aS'So the base rate is not scientific.'
p13792
aS'No, I am not saying that.'
p13793
aS'What I am saying is the base rate has been defined in a scientific manner.'
p13794
aS'If a bank changes or doesnt change the base rate, it has to prove as to what are the factors that are prompting it to do what it is doing.'
p13795
aS'Are the banks treating base rate as a transparent tool for loan pricing?'
p13796
aS'The base rate is certainly much more transparent than the benchmark prime lending rate.'
p13797
aS'Nothing is perfect.'
p13798
aS'We have to have supervisory feedback to know what is happening.'
p13799
aS'You seem to have a bias against NBFCs.'
p13800
aS'They play a very critical role in a financial segment where half of the population does not have access to bank credit, but you keep on hiking their capital requirements.'
p13801
aS'Recently you changed the gold loan norms.'
p13802
aS'Do you want to kill them?'
p13803
aS'Far from it; we want the NBFCs to thrive and serve their clientele.'
p13804
aS'They are very important and I want to make it clear that for us the NBFC sector is a very important segment.'
p13805
aS'Now we have to look at the fact that NBFCs do essentially a bank-like service and the lesson from this crisis is that if you are tightening banking regulation, you have to keep that much of oversight on NBFCs and if you dont do that then the risks will get shifted from the banking sector to the NBFC sector.'
p13806
aS'Whatever we do, we have not yet made the NBFCs fully bank regulation-compliant.'
p13807
aS'All that we are trying to do is to make the system safer, more robust and ensure that the arbitrage between the more tightly regulated banking system and the less tightly regulated NBFC sector is contained.'
p13808
aS'What about microfinance institutions (MFIs)?'
p13809
aS'The Malegam committee report has laid down a number of parameters and we have moved ahead on that.'
p13810
aS'We did issue a circular in December 2011 defining a new category of NBFCs and MFIs.'
p13811
aS'We were hoping that based on that criteria, the NBFCs which are into MFIs business will be able to transit to that, but there are quite a few difficulties, particularly because of the fact that their loan portfolio in Andhra Pradesh seems to have got stuck.'
p13812
aS'The sector has told us that by November 2012 roughly Rs 6,000 crore of assets will become NPAs.'
p13813
aS'Now the issue before us is managing the transition because if Rs 6,000 crore of capital is lost, how do you manage the issue?'
p13814
aS'We are working on this now.'
p13815
aS'This means those MFIs that have restructured loans will not be able to survive even after that.'
p13816
aS'Of course the Rs 6,000 crore figure is for the system as a whole and individually they will have much less, but the issue is that CDR (corporate debt restructuring) addresses your liability side, and addressing only the liability side doesnt help unless your asset side is also managed.'
p13817
aS'So, either they would default on CDR, or they will have to manage their rescheduled liabilities out of the rest of the India portfolio.'
p13818
aS'Are you really concerned?'
p13819
aS'Yes, we are concerned in the sense that we want them to transit to the new framework and the new framework has certain requirements of capital adequacy, etc., which in the current situation is proving to be difficult to achieve.'
p13820
aS'We have to find a way out.'
p13821
aS'Who will have the last word on MFIs, RBI or the Andhra Pradesh government?'
p13822
aS'Thats a difficult question for me to answer because the microfinance Bill is there and once it gets passed, I really dont know constitutionally what will happen.'
p13823
aS'You have told foreign banks that they can convert their Indian operations from branches into subsidiaries but not a single foreign bank has approached you for this.'
p13824
aS'Both we and the government of India are very conscious of the issues involved.'
p13825
aS'Essentially they are tax-related issues.'
p13826
aS'We have flagged these to the government.'
p13827
aS'How soon will it happen?'
p13828
aS'It is with the government and is difficult for me to say, but they have assured us that they are trying to do it as quickly as possible.'
p13829
aS'Why do you need to consult the government for everythingfrom new banking licences to foreign bankss subsidiary?'
p13830
aS'You have autonomy.'
p13831
aS'It is not a question of compromise on autonomy.'
p13832
aS'There are issuesfor example, for the new banks, there are legal issues and RBI has to necessarily get it through the government through the legislation.'
p13833
aS'It has no other dimension.'
p13834
aS'Similarly, for foreign banks, if the tax regime is to be looked into, then the government has to do and RBI has to necessarily go to the government for that.'
p13835
aS'Are there any pockets of concern, particularly among old private banks?'
p13836
aS'When licences were given to two new private sector banksKotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltdwe had said that we would take up the next set of applications after three years.'
p13837

p14388
aS'While bankers claim they are not in a hurry to phase out single-currency cards, they admit that customers now prefer multi-currency cards as they dont have to carry more than one card during foreign travel.'
p14389
aS'It is a much better and stronger product than any single-currency travel card currently available in the market, says a senior official with HDFC Bank.'
p14390
aS'A multi-currency card will be popular among corporates, as their executives often have to travel from one country to another.'

aS'According to bankers, a multi-currency travel card not only saves customers from the burden of carrying several cards; it also offers them protection from exchange rate fluctuations.'
p14393
aS'For instance, if a person has euro card and he travels to Australia, the amount he spends will depend on the foreign exchange rate between euro and the Australian dollar.'
p14394
aS'This is because he has to convert the euro balance in his card into Australian dollar before making payments.'
p14395
aS'But if he has a multi-currency card that allows him to load both euro and the Australian dollar, he does not have to convert euro into the dollar while making payments in the island-continent.'

aS'He added the Bank has credit cards user base of 5.60 million as of March 31, 2012 and this financial year, it is targeting to add another 1 million customers.'
p14614
aS'The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to relax some of the norms pertaining to microfinance institutions net worth, capital adequacy and provisioning needs.'
p14615
aS'The roll-out of the new regulatory regime has run into some bottlenecks.'
p14616
aS'Some MFIs are unable to comply with the qualifying asset criterion for registering as non-banking finance company-MFIs and, therefore, banks are reluctant to make fresh loans to them, as such loans do not qualify as priority sector lending, RBI governor D Subbarao said at an event organised by Indian Overseas Bank.'
p14617
aS'Small MFIs are also not able to meet the Rs 5 crore entry point capital to be eligible to register as an NBFC-MFI.'
p14618
aS'In particular, Andhra Pradesh-based MFIs, saddled with huge losses, large NPAs (non-performing assets) and eroded capital, are facing an especially acute problem in complying with the capital and provisioning norms.'
p14619
aS'RBI is working on resolving these issues, so that MFI operations can get back on track, he added.'
p14620
aS'On December 2, 2011, the NBFC-MFI was created as a new category of finance company, and told to ensure 100 per cent provisioning on aggregate loan instalments overdue for 180 days or more.'
p14621
aS'MFIs were so far maintaining 10 per cent provisioning on the loan amount where repayment was due to this extent.'
p14622
aS'These norms were supposed to be effective from April 1.'
p14623
aS'In March, the banking regulator had extended the deadline for new provisioning and asset classification norms by a year, to allow the troubled sector more time to get their house back in order.'
p14624
aS'These rules, RBI said, would be effective from April 1, 2013.'
p14625
aS'Subbarao, however, noted that investors sentiment towards the sector had improved in recent months, with some MFIs able to raise money from venture capital funds.'
p14626
aS'Banks have been found to discriminate between their customers while pricing loans, as the process lacked transparency, Subbarao said.'
p14627
aS'In particular, the spread levied on customers differed widely, even if the risk profile was the same.'
p14628
aS'Typically, banks spread depends on the nature of loans, over the benchmark lending rate or the base rate.'
p14629
aS'RBI mandate banks to link all loans to the base rate, except for a specified few.'
p14630
aS'One problem that has persisted even after the introduction of the base rate system relates to the lack of transparency in the customer-specific spread charged to a borrower over the base rate.'
p14631
aS'There have been complaints that the spread charged to a customer has been revised upwards without any apparent change in her risk profile.'
p14632
aS'Also, where floating rate loans are concerned, existing customers have been disadvantaged vis-a-vis new customers with similar credit ratings, resulting in complaints about discrimination, Subbarao said.'
p14633
aS'RBI has constituted a group to determine the principles that should govern a proper, transparent and non-discriminatory pricing of credit.'
p14634
aS'Headed by deputy governor Anand Sinha, it is to give a report by August.'
p14635
aS'Despite having freed the interest rate on savings bank deposits, large banks are not responding and RBI expects more activeness.'
p14636
aS'(We) look forward to more active play in the savings bank segment, with banks coming out with some customer-friendly innovations, especially aimed at attracting lower income households, presently outside the banking sector, Subbarao said.'
p14637
aS'He noted seven relatively small private banks had raised their savings bank rates.'
p14638
aS'This expectedly improved their market share in the segment, he said.'
p14639
aS'RBI deregulated these rates in October.'
p14640
aS'Since then, YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra, IndusInd, Karnataka Bank, Ratnakar Bank and Saraswat Bank had raised their savings bank rate to 5.5-7 per cent, depending on the size of the deposit.'
p14641
aS'RBI outreach programme to take banking to villages has not seen any major impact, Subbarao said at an event.'
p14642
aS'There have been complaints that banking correspondents have not been trained.'
p14643
aS'Terming the impact of RBI\'s decision to deregulate savings accounts rates last year as "insignificant" for HDFC Bank, Managing Director and Chief Executive of the bank Aditya Puri has said depositors should be content with 4% interest offered by larger lenders.'
p14644
aS'"The deregulation of the savings account has not had a substantial impact on our growth," Puri told shareholders at the AGM over the weekend here.'
p14645
aS'"The savings account is a transaction account and there is a cost attached to it.'
p14646
aS'So, four% rate is fair and that\'s why you see most of the larger banks have not changed it," he said.'
p14647
aS'Puri further said only a couple of banks have increased their pricing because they were not getting traction on the savings deposits front.'
p14648
aS"Following RBI's move last October to lift the interest rate cap of 4% on savings account, a few lenders like YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Saraswat Bank increased their offerings up to seven%, giving rise to expectations that there will be a flight of deposits to these lenders."
p14649
aS'However, bigger banks, including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, which enjoy a very high%age of the cheaper Casa (current and savings account) deposits, maintained a status quo keeping the savings rates unchanged.'
p14650
aS"HDFC Bank's Casa share in the total base fell to 46% as of June 30, versus 49.1% a year ago on a lower growth in current account deposits."
p14651
aS'However, there was a growth of 18.4% on savings deposits to Rs 76,674 crore, according to Q1 numbers.'
p14652
aS'Puri said economic feasibility requires a balance of at least Rs 7,000 in every savings account as a host of services are to be offered free of charge to the account-holder.'

p14660

p14662
aS"SKS's reported networth of Rs 435 crore as of March 31, 2012 would increase to Rs 700 crore (approximate) after the QIP and proposed preferential allotment, the company said."

p15013
aS'The move comes at a time when LIC has increased stake in public sector banks by purchasing shares both from the secondary market and through direct equity infusion via preferential allotment.'

p15021
aS'Thus, LIC can invest up to 10 per cent of the capital employed by the investee company, or 10 per cent of the fund size in a corporate entity, whichever is lower.'
p15022
aS'The capital employed includes share capital, free reserves and debentures or bonds.'

aS'The lenders wanted to first sell Deccan Chargers and then stabilise the company as it needs funding.'

p16443
aS'Electric vehicles have largely failed to cut ice with consumers globally, but that has not stopped homegrown automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra from dreaming big for its first four-seater electric car, the e20, launched earlier last month.'
p16444
aS'"If anybody can succeed in promoting the use of electric vehicles in India, it is going to be us," says Chairman Anand Mahindra.'
p16445
aS'The company has set a target to sell 500 units every month.'
p16446
aS"For electric cars, that's a huge target, but it's easy to understand why Mahindra is betting on the car."
p16447
aS'With an operating cost of Rs 0.50 per km-nearly one-tenth of that of petrol cars and one-fifth of diesel cars -and a price tag substantially lower than its counterparts globally at Rs 5.96 lakh, the e20 has several advantages.'
p16448
aS'It does not require regular servicing, it is low on maintenance and being fully automatic, it is easy to manoeuvre in traffic.'
p16449
aS'However, despite the apparent positives, industry experts say electric vehicles are still not ready for primetime in India.'
p16450
aS'The most fundamental problem facing the car is its inability to support long drives.'

aS"The e20's lithium-ion batteries can only go for 100 kms per charge."
p16452
aS'While the car can be recharged using any 15 amp socket - just as laptops and mobile phones - lack of charging points along highways makes it unsuitable for weekend getaways.'

aS'For now, the company has only set up 253 charging stations in eight cities where the e2o will be launched.'

aS"Sales figures for Reva, the country's sole electric car until now, underscores Ramakrishnan's point."
p16458
aS'Fewer than 5,000 units of the car have been sold in the 10 years that Reva has been in the market.'
p16459
aS'Nearly half of that has been due to exports to European markets such as the UK and Norway.'
p16460
aS'Clearly, it is the high cost of cars that is holding consumers globally from taking to electric vehicles.'

aS'Replacing the imported Lithium-ion battery, which comes with a warranty of three years or 60,000 km, could set you back by as much as Rs 150,000.'
p16466
aS"In the absence of cheaper batteries, the company is banking on the car's cost advantages to drive sales."
p16467
aS'"We have to count on the desires of the consumer to own a vehicle like this and to spend a bit on that.'
p16468
aS'There is no doubt, it is the most cost-efficient car to own in India.'

aS'The operating cost of the e2o is 50 paise per km as compared to running costs of Rs 5-6 per km for a petrol car.'
p16470
aS'On driving an average of 1200 km every month, a customer would be able to realise savings in fuel cost of about Rs 70,000 every year," says Pawan Goenka, chairman, Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles.'
p16471
aS'At present, the price of the e2o varies from state to state depending on the subsidy provided by the government there.'
p16472
aS'However, the prices could come down by Rs 1-1.5 lakh if the Central government also decides to offer subsidies under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan.'
p16473
aS'In the meantime, the company is reaping the benefits of low research and manufacturing costs in India vis-a-vis other countries.'

aS"The company's facility in Bangalore is among the largest in the world for electric cars."
p16479
aS'It has an annual capacity of 30,000 vehicles.'
p16480
aS'However, it does not have a paint shop, press shop or a body shop.'
p16481
aS'The body panels of the e2o are made of polymers and glued on to the frame by hand.'
p16482
aS'The technology is not meant for mass production as it takes 12-13 minutes to roll out a car as compared to one to two minutes for manufacturing a regular (internal combustion engine) vehicle.'
p16483
aS'However, not everyone believes the prospects are bright for electric vehicles in India.'
p16484
aS'"The e2o is an interesting product and is priced competitively.'
p16485
aS'But electricity grids in India do not have the capacity to charge households, how can it be expected to power a population of electric vehicles?'
p16486
aS'India needs to work on power generation and transmission before talking about electric vehicles," says Deepesh Rathore, managing director, IHS Automotive India.'
p16487
aS"The car's dependence on India's coal-fired power plants also raises questions about its actual environmental costs."
p16488
aS'"Electric vehicles are only as \'green\' as the energy sources used to charge them.'
p16489
aS'Charging electric vehicles in India remains a challenge as 60 per cent of electricity is generated from coal-fired power plants," says a YES Bank report in association with Teri BCSD.'
p16490
aS'Mahindra & Mahindra counters such charges by citing reduced CO2 emissions.'
p16491
aS'"Even if the e2o is charged from the grid, the carbon dioxide emissions are at least 30 per cent lower as compared to a fossil fuel-powered vehicle," says Goenka.'
p16492
aS'In addition, the car is also equipped to harness the energy of the Sun to charge itself.'
p16493
aS'Goenka says,"It would have given sales a push if the government had announced incentives and implemented infrastructural development programmes under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan.'
p16494
aS'But one should not make subsidies a pre-condition for success of this car.'

aS'Most of these companies have a significant amount of pledged promoter shares and there are indications about margin-calls being triggered on these counters.'

p16506
aS'Select companies in the cement, metal and paper-related pack also disappointed.'
p16507

aS'The Reserve bank today said it is seized of the ongoing boardroom battle at private lender Yes Bank and may make necessary changes in the required norms on appointment of directors on bank boards if needed.'
p17927
aS'"This boardroom battle which is going on (at Yes Bank), we are studying it and if we think that some measure needs to be taken on the issue, we will look into that," said Deputy Governor in-Charge of Banking Supervision Anand Sinha during the customary post-policy interaction at the RBI headquarters.'
p17928
aS"He was talking against the backdrop of a legal case filed by Madhu Kapur, wife of Yes Bank's deceased promoter Ashok Kapur, seeking a board seat for her daughter Shagun Gogia as a promoter nominee director, among others."
p17929
aS'The application of Gogia was rejected by the bank board at its June 27 meeting, saying she did not meet the "fit and proper" criteria laid down by the RBI for appointing directors.'
p17930
aS'However, Gogia claimed that she met the necessary criteria and questioned as to why the bank board was not forwarding her application to the RBI to decide on merit.'
p17931
aS'"On the appointment of directors, the Banking Regulation Act does specify certain qualifications, while additionally, there are shareholder directives as well," Sinha said.'
p17932
aS'To another question, Sinha said there was no prohibition on promoters from taking executive jobs in banks.'
p17933
aS'Sinha informed that RBI has increased the age limit for board members to 70 and in the Yes Bank case, appointment of one of the directors has been cleared only for a year.'
p17934
aS'Two of the recently appointed directors of Yes Bank -- Srinivasan and Diwan Arun Nanda -- are above 69.'
p17935
aS'Without naming either of them, Sinha said, "There is an age limit of 70 and it is not very hard, but generally observed.'
p17936
aS'When he was appointed, he was well short of 70.'
p17937
aS'Some part of his term may go beyond 70, and (therefore) he has been given approval for only one year."'
p17938
aS'Sinha also said he has read that the board seems to feel that the candidate is not of the same level as others.'
p17939
aS'"That is their perception, and we don\'t come into the way."'
p17940
aS'It is extremely rare (if not the first time) for an old-generation private sector bank in India to buy assets of a foreign bank that has presence in more than 40 countries.'
p17941
aS'But Ratnakar Bank can now hardly be described as an old-generation bank.'
p17942
aS"The Kolhapur-based lender, which prefers to describe itself as 'one of India's fastest growing banks', is led by team of professionals recruited mostly from foreign and private banks."
p17943
aS"Its chief Vishwavir Ahuja is the former CEO of Bank of America's India business, head of strategy and markets Rajeev Ahuja joined from Citi and head of corporate and institutional banking R Gurumurthy has worked with Standard Chartered Bank."
p17944
aS'The senior leadership team also consists of professionals who have worked with Deutsche Bank, Bharti AXA Life Insurance and YES Bank.'
p17945
aS'The private lender is backed by a host of domestic and global investors  HDFC, Norwest Venture Partners, Aditya Birla Private Equity and Samara Capital, to name a few  and is probably as aggressive as some of its new-age rivals.'
p17946
aS"On Friday, Ratnakar Bank said it has agreed to buy Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) business banking, credit cards and mortgage portfolios in India."
p17947
aS"The move followed RBS' failure to close a deal with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) to sell these assets after negotiating for almost two-and-a-half-years."
p17948
aS'Other private sector banks including Axis Bank, YES Bank and IndusInd Bank were initially interested in buying the portfolios after RBS and HSBC scraped their deal.'
p17949
aS'So, what are the benefits Ratnakar Bank is looking for from this deal?'
p17950
aS'The bank believes the transaction will complement well with its existing businesses and help it add strength in the desired product and customer segments.'
p17951
aS'The deal will shift over 120,000 customers of RBS India to Ratnakar Bank, which currently services 5,00,000 clients.'
p17952
aS'According to bankers, this will help the old-generation private sector bank to improve its brand visibility, something they say is essential for the private bank before it gets listed on the stock exchanges.'
p17953
aS'It is learnt that the deal is not capital intensive and is unlikely to stress the financial position of Ratnakar Bank, which has a capital adequacy ratio of over 17% (at the end of March, 2013) and had raised Rs 324 crore earlier this financial year.'
p17954
aS'A banker familiar with the developments, on condition of anonymity, said the transaction suits the Indian private bank as it will gain access to the credit card market.'
p17955
aS'While prior to this acquisition Ratnakar Bank did not have a credit card portfolio, RBS had a portfolio of over 89,000 credit cards at the end of June, 2013.'
p17956
aS'"The quality of RBS\' cards portfolio is not very bad, the pricing made sense, so why not?'
p17957
aS'Sometimes the inorganic route is better than building a business from the scratch," the banker said.'
p17958
aS'The transaction will also help Ratnakar Bank to scale up its existing home loan business.'
p17959
aS"At the end of 2012-13, the private lender's direct loan exposure in residential mortgages was only Rs 67.32 crore."
p17960
aS'Another reason to secure the deal was probably the lure of low-cost deposits.'
p17961
aS"RBS' business banking portfolio is believed to have a large number of current account customers, who will now shift to Ratnakar Bank."
p17962
aS'The private lender has been finding it difficult to expand its current account savings account (CASA) deposits with its CASA ratio narrowing to 19.7% in 2012-13 from 21.5% a year earlier.'
p17963
aS'It is one of the few banks that is offering more than four% interest on savings deposits to attract customers.'
p17964
aS'Ratnakar Bank has also decided to absorb the employees of RBS associated with the businesses that are being acquired and according to bankers this is likely to be one of the few challenges that the lender has to overcome.'
p17965
aS"Typically, employee unions of old-age private banks resist fresh recruitments and the pay-scale of most RBS' staff is likely to be higher than many of the employees of Ratnakar Bank."
p17966
aS'Vishwavir Ahuja had ensured that there was no union unrest when he and his team took charge of the bank in mid-2010 and he will need to mirror that success once more.'
p17967
aS"The lawyer of Madhu Kapur, widow of former YES bank director Ashok Kapur, on Monday argued before the Bombay High Court her married daughter, Shagun Gogia, deserved to be nominated as director to the bank's board on her own merit."
p17968
aS'"She was not just her father\'s daughter but was duly qualified," said Madhu\'s counsel Darius Khambata, arguing before Justice S J Kathawala who was hearing a suit filed by Madhu and Shagun, challenging the rejection of Shagun\'s nomination by the bank\'s board of directors.'
p17969
aS'The counsel said non-executive chairman M R Srinivasan had even asked Shagun to send her biodata, and after going through it, Srinivasan had said "it is impressive" and forwarded it to Rana Kapoor, the current managing director and chief executive officer.'
p17970
aS'This showed Shagun was more than qualified for the post, Khambata said, adding "Rana Kapoor had taken away our rights and the bank had assisted in such act".'
p17971
aS'He further said seven years ago, Ashok Kapur and Rana Kapoor signed an agreement with Rabobank to promote YES Bank, in which they held 51 per cent stake.'
p17972
aS'It was also agreed Ashok and Rana were entitled to nominate or recommend directors.'
p17973
aS'"Today, Rana Kapoor says in the court we have no right," Khambata said.'
p17974
aS'Madhu Kapur has also sought a stay from the court to the appointment of M R Srinivasan, Diwan Arun Nanda and Ravish Chopra as the directors.'
p17975
aS'Ashok Kapur died in 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.'
p17976
aS'While his wife Madhu and two children (Shagun and son Gaurav Kapur) together hold 12 per cent interest in the bank, Rana Kapoor, who founded the bank with Ashok in 2003, holds 13.7 per cent.'

p17978
aS'Arguments would continue on Tuesday.'

aS'Once upon a time, that is, in March 2013, banking stocks used to be a "must own" in every domestic and foreign institutional investor portfolio.'
p17980
aS'Any dissenting view (expressed by us, for instance, in a research note dated April 4, 2013) was met with general ridicule.'
p17981
aS'Four months later... anybody owning Indian bank stocks is being talked of as a liability to his/her fund house.'
p17982
aS'Banks stocks have collapsed between 25 and 60 per cent since March this year, and they still look wobbly.'
p17983
aS'So what explains this collapse?'
p17984
aS'Deep macro analysis of Indian banking reveals a rather counter-intuitive reason.'
p17985
aS'And that reason is that our banks are too profitable.'
p17986
aS"Before we analyse banking, first let's look at telecom."
p17987
aS'We have always regarded telecom to be a perfect commodity business.'
p17988
aS'Get a licence, outsource the towers and the customer service.'
p17989
aS'Be a virtual company only engaged in the business of customer acquisition.'
p17990
aS'This is done through aggressive marketing, and so on.'
p17991
aS'If you can hoard some spectrum, as was done by some players in the first half of 2000s, then even better.'
p17992
aS'Nearly all companies engaged in the business can end up doing pretty much what everybody else does.'
p17993
aS"Capital availability is about the only differentiator in the business, but if margins are high enough, this doesn't remain a constraint."
p17994
aS'This is precisely the problem telecoms had in 2007, when we turned bearish on the sector.'
p17995
aS'Bharti was making 42 per cent earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation margins, 27 per cent return on equity (RoE)...for doing, frankly, nothing very special.'
p17996
aS'In a perfectly competitive country like India, margins like that attract new players with new capital.'
p17997
aS'Unlike the US, where there are a number of factors that limit the movement of companies from one sector to another (largely anti-competitive measures), India suffers from no such problem.'
p17998
aS'Corporate India moves easily and en masse into businesses where they see some average company make super-normal margins.'
p17999
aS"That's what happened in telecom in 2008, and we now know how the sector's margins and RoEs went into a free-fall."
p18000
aS'Commodity businesses sporting artificially high margins never last too long in India.'
p18001
aS'Banking is the ultimate commodity business, even more than telecom.'
p18002
aS"A depositor has little interest in a bank's brand value."
p18003
aS'As long as, broadly, a bank meets the sniff test of safety, a depositor will shop around for the best rates on his deposits.'
p18004
aS"On the borrowing side, it's even worse: a borrower cares even less about his lending bank's brand value."
p18005
aS'He is merely interested in getting the lowest rates and the fastest approvals for his loan.'
p18006
aS'Opening a bank branch is easy.'
p18007
aS'There are no great complexities of technology or logistics required.'
p18008
aS'Each bank can easily duplicate what the next bank is doing.'
p18009
aS'There is near-zero product differentiation.'
p18010
aS'But looking at the profits Indian banks have been making, you could be pardoned for thinking that this is the most skilled, brand-driven, large-moats-around-its-business kind of enterprise.'
p18011
aS"These are profits of some our major banks: (we have used a dollar/rupee rate of $45 to erase the effect of the rupee's steep fall, in order to make our banks' numbers consistent with global banks'): HDFC Bank makes a profit of $1.8 billion, ICICI $1.8 billion, Axis Bank $1.2 billion, Kotak Bank $500 million and YES Bank $300 million."
p18012
aS"Now, look at some global banks' profits: HSBC, inarguably the world's most globalised bank in the world, makes a profit of $14 billion, Bank of America makes a profit $4.5 billion, BNP Paribas makes $6 billion, Banco Santander makes $2.2 billion and Credit Suisse makes $1.3 billion."
p18013
aS'Many of these banks have footprints that span the world.'
p18014
aS'Contrast this with our Indian banks.'
p18015
aS'They are 100 per cent single-country focused, that too, a very poor country with low paying capacity for banking services and products.'
p18016
aS'And even within India, they are still very urban-centric, and with none of them capable of being called truly pan-Indian operations.'
p18017
aS'And yet, their profits are simply massive, even when compared to their global peers.'
p18018
aS'The perspective becomes even more refined and stark when you compare our banks to other, old-line, decades-old companies.'
p18019
aS'Godrej Consumer, born in 1897, makes a profit of $180 million.'
p18020
aS'Hindustan Unilever Ltd makes a profit of $850 million, again after 100-plus years in India.'
p18021
aS'Nestle makes $240 million, Dabur $300 million, ITC $1.8 billion, Bajaj Auto $650 million.'
p18022
aS'All these companies have marquee, iconic brands, have been around for decades, have distribution reaching down to the smallest villages in India, have business models that are impossible for a new entrant to replicate in any meaningful way.'
p18023
aS'And yet, their profit numbers are nothing when compared to our banks who have been around less than 20 years, and most, less than 10 years in any substantial way (Kotak, YES).'
p18024
aS"Think about this: in just five to seven years' time YES Bank has built up profits of $300 million-plus, more than what a storied company like Nestle makes even after decades in India."
p18025
aS'Now, one could have understood if YES Bank was doing something very special or unreplicable by anybody else, that it had some crucial proprietary edge in the business that led it to such massive profits.'
p18026
aS'But it has nothing of that sort.'
p18027
aS'It is still plain banking, like every other private sector bank.'
p18028
aS'The same goes for the rest, like Kotak or ING Vysya, all of which make profits far in excess of what is rationally achievable in what is a vanilla, commodity business, with no moats around it.'
p18029
aS'Even if these banks were making their money from principal trading, these numbers may have been justifiable, because trading requires very special skills, and hence, there are no practical limits on how much money a bank can make in this activity.'
p18030
aS'But to make this global level of profits for doing age-old borrowing + lending + some treasury operations seems completely unsustainable.'
p18031
aS'Super-normal profits are the result of doing something better than what anybody else can.'
p18032
aS"Facebook, a very young company can make $1 billion in profit (far less than HDFC Bank, we may point out) because you simply can't create another Facebook that easily."
p18033
aS'But can you create another HDFC Bank?'
p18034
aS"Well, If YES Bank can, in just five short years, reach one-sixteenth its size and Kotak can reach one-fourth its size, this business can't be that difficult, can it?"
p18035
aS'If this business is not that difficult, then how can these gargantuan profits last?'
p18036
aS'The truth is that Indian banking suffers from too little competition at the quality end, leading to these profits.'
p18037
aS"Just as call rates crashed in telecom, leading to greater common good in society, thanks to A Raja's telecom perestroika, a slew of new bank licences should be issued that will hopefully lead to the whittling down of these unjustified, sky-high profit numbers of the existing players, thereby making banking services more affordable for the masses."
p18038
aS"It doesn't require any recondite analysis to see where Indian banks' profit are headed... or for that matter, their stocks."
p18039
aS"It's time to sound the tocsin on Indian banking."

p18059
aS'Credit substitutes constitute just 14% to 15% of our customer assets, down from previously, because we have monetized about Rs.2,500 crore to Rs.3,000 crore of such bonds last quarter, Kapoor said, adding that he expects Yes Banks loan growth at 24-25% in this fiscal year.'

p18681
aS"RBI, in its 'guidelines for licensing of new banks in the private sector', had specified that the initial minimum paid-up equity capital for a bank shall be 500 crore."

aS'"We may look at relaxing the norms to broaden the pool and invite more applicants," the official said.'

p18689
aS'Kotak Mahindra Bank and YES Bank received banking licences in 2003-04.'
p18690
aS'The official also said a relaxation in the Rs 500-crore criterion may be provided on a case-by-case basis.'
p18691
aS'Further, the relaxation may come into play once RBI shifts to the on-top method that is it issues licences whenever an applicant meets the criterion.'
p18692
aS'The central bank is of the opinion that financial inclusion should be the larger focus of all new banks, and corporate lending and other activities should only support this endeavour.'
p18693
aS'"So, if there are applicants who have a viable model and this initial capital of Rs 500 crore is a deterrent, then we may relax it to support their plans," the official said, adding there will be no relaxation in the capital adequacy requirement, which is 13% for new banks.'
p18694
aS'RBI, however, is strictly against issuing bank licences to corporate houses that are being investigated for diversion of funds.'

aS'Most of the banks have also cut rates on home loans and car loans or reduced the processing charges.'
p18712
aS'The overall impact on margins on account of consumer durable or two-wheeler loans might not be much, since the share of these in the total portfolio is less.'
p18713
aS'However, since the operating expenses are higher and if PSBs are not able to meet the overall credit standards that private banks have, then it could affect overall profitability, says Vaibhav Agrawal, vice-president, research, Angel Broking.'
p18714
aS'The problem faced by PSBs in such loans is although these are secured (the white goods or two-wheeler is hypothecated with the bank), repossession is difficult and there is no resale market, says C V R Rajendran, executive director, Bank of Maharashtra.'

aS'Recovery is expensive.'

p18840
aS'Market participants said LIC had been increasing stake in IT and pharmaceutical companies through the past year.'
p18841
aS'As valuations in these sectors had risen, the insurer was now booking profits.'
p18842
aS'"Investors had been taking refuge in IT and pharma stocks and this had pushed up valuations.'

aS"However, some brokers said LIC wasn't an active buyer or seller of equities, as it liked to hold on for the long term."

aS'Icra said lenders may incur losses to the tune of Rs 2,700 crore on loans extended to the Andhra Pradesh-based MFIs, as recovery from borrowers in the state remains insignificant.'

p18866
aS'Credit costs for MFIs could rise from current low levels (0.4 per cent for non-Andhra Pradesh MFIs) due to the high growth rates, expansion in newer geographies, vulnerable borrower profile and high employee attrition rate (30-40 per cent) for the industry.'

aS'Though profit growth was partly added by one-offs, the overall performance was good, with the bank doing well on asset quality and net interest margins (NIMs).'

aS'Private banks AFS exposure is more on the corporate bond side, having higher yields.'
p18961

p18963
aS'Most analysts believe the impact on the profits of public sector banks (PSBs), yet to announce their results, will be huge.'
p18964
aS'They have higher AFS exposure and limited leverage (a lower ratio of current and savings accounts, lower net interest margins and fee income, weak return ratios and higher duration bonds) to cushion the impact.'
p18965
aS'In ICICI, for example, the average duration of its AFS portfolio is below a year; for Canara or Punjab National, this is estimated at a little more than three years.'
p18966
aS'Considering AFS positioning as of June 30, along with RBI relaxations, PSBs like SBI, PNB, Canara, Corporation and Union Bank are expected to witness significant MTM losses in the September quarter, says  Agarwal.'
p18967
aS'As a one-off measure, RBI had allowed banks to move SLR securities such as government and corporate bonds to HTM from AFS/HFT.'
p18968
aS'And,  said they could choose to spread their MTM losses on these securities over the next three or seven quarters.'
p18969
aS'This was to enable them to avoid huge losses on their AFS portfolio, as yields had surged and so, bond prices had fallen.'

aS'Banks are required to provide for the decline (loss) in the value of bonds under the AFS/HFT categories and vice versa.'
p18973
aS'Analysts say a 100 basis points rise in government bond yield will lead to roughly Rs 33,000 crore of MTM provision in one quarter, almost double the first quarter profit of all banks together (Rs 19,849 crore) or close to half the yearly profit of 2012-13 (Rs 77,045 crore).'

p19724
aS'At present, the cost-to-income ratio for most banks stands at 45-50 per cent.'
p19725
aS"This means, expenses eat half of banks' income, making banking a costly affair."
p19726
aS'As a result, most private and public-sector banks pass on some of the burden to customers by charging more for various services.'

p19752
aS'Some have also begun partial shutdown of ATMs at night in areas where usage is low.'
p19753
aS'Several state governments have also asked banks to ensure round-the-clock guards at ATMs, which is a costly affair at Rs 30,000-40,000 a month.'
p19754
aS'Plus, there will have to be enough transactions to justify that expense.'
p19755
aS'For banks, servicing a customer at a branch is the most expensive, followed by ATM and then net banking.'
p19756
aS'Customers will have to share the cost burden, say experts.'
p19757
aS'"Apart from the cost of security at ATMs, costs caught up with banks also due to some Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines like ATMs cannot be used for advertising.'

aS'While terming it inevitable, experts say the world over, customers are charged for most banking services.'
p19762
aS'Experts say that in the US, banks charge a fee for ATM transactions made at rival banks.'
p19763
aS'Sometimes customers are charged by both the rival and their own bank for the same.'
p19764
aS"There is also a fee for refusing services due to insufficient funds or having used the daily limit, and also for checking account balance at other banks' ATM."
p19765
aS"It's only that Indian banks' customers are used to free or low-cost structure for banking facilities."
p19766
aS'And, hence, a higher fee comes across as a shocker.'
p19767
aS'At the same time, some opine that something as basic as ATM transactions need not be charged.'
p19768
aS'Other facilities such as mobile or net banking may be charged as additional and high-tech facilities for transactions.'
p19769
aS'"This is largely because banks hardly make any money on net or mobile transactions.'
p19770
aS'For instance, if one books movies tickets online, while the ticket aggregator could earn as much as five per cent, banks make less than a per cent or sometimes even less than 0.5 per cent," says a public sector banker.'
p19771
aS'When ATMs were introduced, banks discouraged customers from banking at their branches.'
p19772
aS'A couple foreign and private banks, say experts, had even levied Rs 50-100 as branch banking fees on customers, say bankers.'
p19773
aS'Then banks provided additional facilities such as mobile and net banking, which made banking further easy.'
p19774
aS'And now they are proposing charges on ATM transactions.'
p19775
aS'Are banks trying to dissuade customers from regular banking, at will?'
p19776
aS'A senior banker reasons that even now, there are charges applicable after five transactions for other bank ATMs.'
p19777
aS'So, it is not that a new cost structure is being put in place.'
p19778
aS'Agrees Adhil Shetty of BankBazaar.com: "This is not a move to dissuade customers from easy banking.'
p19779
aS'Banks are only trying to compensate for the high charges they are facing."'
p19780
aS'Shetty adds in the mid-2000s, banks had completely removed charging customers transacting at other bank ATMs.'
p19781
aS"However, given the cost they are facing, it doesn't make sense to service outside customers for free."
p19782
aS'Doing so, however, would be unfair from the viewpoint of a customer, who is used to getting free service.'
p19783
aS'"Rise in banking charges in a country like India will neither benefit customers nor banks," says V N Kulkarni, chief counsellor at Abhay Debt Counselling Centre of Bank of India.'

aS'Many people withdraw small amounts every week or even every day.'
p19785
aS'There could also be some who have income from multiple sources and, hence, might be forced to withdraw as and when they receive funds in their account.'
p19786
aS'Such individuals will be charged unnecessarily, Kulkarni points out.'
p19787
aS'He adds that if ATM charges are increased, "then such customers will throng bank branches, thus making it expensive for banks, which I don\'t think banks have factored in".'
p19788
aS'One option for banks could be not counting for all kinds of ATM transactions to be charged.'
p19789
aS'For instance, checking balance.'
p19790
aS'Right now, each time you use an ATM for any service - cash withdrawal, cash deposit, checking account balance, etc - it is considered a transaction.'
p19791
aS'The senior banker agrees but explains there is some cost involved in offering any service and somebody has to pay for it.'
p19792
aS'As for customers, they could shift to bank(s) levying lower charges.'
p19793
aS'However, since most banks have increased charges, it might not be easy.'
p19794
aS'Charges at public sector banks may be lower than private and foreign banks.'
p19795
aS"Try moving to net banking, as that's the cheaper option."
p19796
aS"Also, close savings accounts you don't use."
p19797
aS'There is still room for hope.'

aS'Rather, careful liquidity calibration through various liquidity windows will ensure an efficient transmission.'

aS'Important to note that, transmission had remained weak in the declining interest rate cycle beginning January 2013 to September 2013 wherein while the repo rate was reduced by 75 basis points., the base rates in the banking system had not moved lower by much.'

aS'Then these banks take credit for the service tax paid on these items for payment of taxes on other taxable services.'

aS'Arguably, the two most egregious economic policy mistakes of the past that continue to haunt India were the licensing of Indian industry during the Nehru years and the nationalisation of private banks by Indira Gandhi in 1969.'
p20349
aS'These actions had one common disastrous feature: penalising and expropriating the Indian private sector.'
p20350
aS'Other policies that turned out to have adverse consequences were different in principle.'
p20351
aS'They at least purported to help the private sector (such as the imposition of trade barriers to protect industry from foreign competition) or fill in for it (such as the creation of the public sector).'
p20352
aS'Restrictive industrial licensing policies have been almost completely reversed, although their consequences still linger (most notably in the weak performance of Indian manufacturing).'
p20353
aS"But bank nationalisation endures as a millstone around the Indian economy, a grim reminder and legacy of Indira Gandhi's policies."

p20355
aS'The problem is so intractable and so embedded in Indian politics that only he can, and can afford to, take on the challenge.'
p20356
aS'On the face of it, that task has begun.'
p20357
aS'The RBI will soon be awarding new banking licences to allow for a greater role for private sector banks.'
p20358
aS'But this may not be enough.'
p20359
aS'Consider why.'
p20360
aS'Since 1991, an overarching principle for eliminating inefficiency in vast parts of the economy has been this: to promote competition via private sector entry rather than change ownership through privatisation.'
p20361
aS'This approach had some intrinsic merit - after all, Russia went from communism to gangsterism because it sold public assets cheaply to a few oligarchs.'
p20362
aS'More importantly, the entry-favouring approach had the virtue of political expediency.'
p20363
aS'Privatising public sector companies would have encountered significant opposition from their managers as well as from strong unions.'
p20364
aS'Allowing private sector companies to enter the market without touching the public sector incumbents bypassed some of these costs and allowed reform to proceed by stealth.'
p20365
aS'The logic and hope, of course, were that a vibrant private sector would grow rapidly while the public sector would shrink, at least in relative terms.'
p20366
aS'And the strategy broadly worked.'
p20367
aS'Yes, Air India is still a mess and a public burden, but the Indian aviation and telecommunication sectors of today are mercifully - and unrecognisably - different from what they were 20 years ago, with enormous benefits for the Indian economy.'
p20368
aS'Public sector companies now account for a small share of the overall size of these sectors.'
p20369
aS'This entry-favouring strategy was tried in banking too.'
p20370
aS'Since the early 1990s, a number of new banking licences were given to the private sector - think of ICICI, HDFC, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra, Yes Bank, and so on.'
p20371
aS'Yet, the share of public sector banks in total banking (measured as a share of assets or deposits) has stubbornly persisted around 75 per cent.'
p20372
aS'And the reason is simple.'
p20373
aS"The private banks have grown, but the public sector banks have grown too because India's politicians have used them as a way to channel money to private sector operators - often very influential ones."
p20374
aS'The credit boom of the 2000s, which is now manifesting itself in rising non-performing loans, emanated mostly in the public sector.'
p20375
aS'Vijay Mallya did not borrow from private banks; he was enabled into borrowing from, and undermining, the public ones.'
p20376
aS'So, going forward the fact of more private banks is no guarantee of reducing the role of public sector banks.'
p20377
aS'This will be especially true if the new banks are encumbered with regulations such as priority sector lending, which restricts their ability to grow.'
p20378
aS'So, as new banking licences are awarded, the aim should be to tilt the playing field as much as possible against the public sector incumbents in whose favour the playing field is already hugely tilted by way of unlimited financial support from the public exchequer.'
p20379
aS'One possibility relates to foreign banks.'
p20380
aS'It is true that the world over - and especially in the United States - regulators are forcing foreign banks to create subsidiaries in host countries so that they will have more capital to cushion against crises.'
p20381
aS'But in India the benefits of subsidiarisation must be weighed against the costs of deterring foreign bank entry, which might have other benefits such as being able to effectively compete and out-compete public sector banks.'
p20382
aS'What can be done more directly to reduce the role of public sector banks?'
p20383
aS'Because such banks are important levers of political control and influence, and because bank unions remain powerful, explicit privatisation seems off the table.'
p20384
aS'But there is an indirect way of privatising them, or at least beginning the process of privatisation, which the RBI should seize.'
p20385
aS'And the opportunities could present themselves soon.'
p20386
aS'As growth declines and exposes the fragility of some of the public banks in the form of rising non-performing loans, the RBI should be brutal in its assessment of them, erring on the side of declaring some banks as unviable commercial institutions.'
p20387
aS'The government will want to bail out the failing banks through fresh capital infusions.'
p20388
aS'But here is where the RBI should stand firm, urging the government to let them go, on the grounds that a fragile economy can afford neither the fiscal costs of bailouts nor the efficiency costs of bad banks continuing to be prolonged on life support.'
p20389
aS'The worse the economy, the more the bargaining chips Dr Rajan will have.'
p20390
aS'And he should use them to resolve the bad public banks, in part by transferring their good parts to the private sector.'
p20391
aS'This strategy may sound difficult to implement.'
p20392
aS'Indeed, it will be.'
p20393
aS'But it is the only way forward.'
p20394
aS'The past two decades have taught us that private banks cannot really grow unless and until public sector banks are shrunk.'
p20395
aS'That shrinking may have to be achieved by allowing the bad public sector banks to fail because politics will never allow good public sector banks to be privatised.'
p20396
aS'It was famously said that in science progress is made one funeral at a time.'
p20397

p20698
aS"The bank's loss more than doubled to Rs 1,238 crore in October-December 2013."
p20699
aS"UBI's gross non-performing asset at the end of December stood at Rs 8,546 crore, or 10.82 per cent of all assets, which is much higher than the public sector banks' average of 4.1 per cent, as on 31 March 2013."

p20729
aS'While the boards of all public sector banks have representatives from RBI and the government, it is the chairmen or their deputies who are blamed for all the bad loans.'
p20730
aS'This, bankers explain, is because of a near-dormant role played by the board members (other than the chairmen and executive directors) in key decisions.'

p20735
aS'According to senior finance ministry officials, because an RBI nominee also sits on the board, a more proactive response is expected from the regulator.'
p20736
aS'They also suggest, now that the worst seems to be over, what UBI needs is a new chief executive, and in a year, the bank will be back on track if some discipline regarding loan sanctioning and asset quality is maintained.'

p22283
aS'With the vast change in lifestyles, in which watching a single movie in a mall costs at least a couple of thousand rupees for a family of four, and with the cost of education and health care rising 10-20 per cent annually, the need to save in instruments that return more and are also, most probably, riskier is growing.'

aS'According to the changing times, you also need to change your financial decisions.'
p22285
aS'To start with, the basics:\nA strong bank balance means little: Even if there are lakhs in a bank account, it is earning a paltry rate of return - not even enough to cover for inflation.'

p22287
aS'Financial planners, typically, advise that you have some part of the salary - the amount you would require for monthly expenses - in the bank account.'

aS'But I wanted to have a house of my own," she says.'
p22332
aS"Though property rates, especially in cities such as Mumbai or Delhi, have gone through the roof, financial advisors say that even if you purchase a property in a smaller city or in the outskirts in the initial years, it will appreciate in value over time and provide you with capital to make the next purchase, as it did in Samant's case."
p22333
aS'Go for equities early: A retirement corpus of Rs 2 crore sounds quite good now because even if it is invested in fixed deposits returning nine per cent annually, it would provide Rs 18 lakh as returns.'
p22334
aS'Though the final returns will be impacted by the tax rate applicable, the returns are still not so bad.'
p22335
aS'But, you have to target a much higher rate of return.'
p22336
aS'Assuming the average consumer price inflation at seven per cent yearly, the value of that Rs 2 crore would be only Rs 70-75 lakh after 15 years.'
p22337
aS'Similarly, the value of a monthly income of Rs 1 lakh will be around only Rs 20,000 after 25 years.'
p22338
aS'In other words, you need to save significantly more to ensure a sound corpus.'
p22339
aS'Instead of Rs 2 crore, you would have to target Rs 6-7 crore.'
p22340
aS'The only instrument that can ensure this is equity.'
p22341
aS'As mentioned in the earlier example, even a small monthly investment of Rs 1,500, invested for 30 years at 15 per cent return, will lead to a corpus of Rs 1 crore.'
p22342
aS'If you invest more aggressively, say Rs 10,000-20,000 a month, the result of compounding will ensure a healthy corpus of Rs 10-15 crore over 30 years.'
p22343
aS'But this means you need to start early.'
p22344
aS'The advice: Start small but early.'
p22345
aS'And, increase the equity allocation over time.'
p22346
aS"Important, since there is no long-term capital gains' tax on equities, the returns will be tax-free."

aS'As Trivedi says: "Earlier, familes used to write down monthly expenses, which led to fewer leakages.'

aS"What about the interest in IPOs, following Sebi's decision to allow 10 per cent reservation for retail investors?"
p22620
aS'This (reservation with a discount) will certainly help popularise the OFS product among retail investors, as was the case with institutional investors.'
p22621
aS"Reservation of 10 per cent for retail investors in IPOs of companies that don't meet the profit criteria was primarily to ensure for these companies, institutional support was greater (75 per cent, compared with 50 per cent in other deals)."
p22622
aS'Similarly, retail investors who might not necessarily have the wherewithal to assess such companies have limited exposure.'
p22623
aS'A different yardstick for retail investors?'
p22624
aS'In our view, there is a clear difference in the requirements and approach to investment for the two investor categories---institutional and retail.'
p22625
aS'This is in terms of the disclosure requirements of each category, as well as the approach to pricing.'
p22626
aS'As far as pricing is concerned, retail investors are typically followers of QIBs (qualified institutional buyers); it might be better to encourage retail investors to enter the market through mutual funds/insurance companies rather than direct equity investments.'
p22627
aS'This will also aid better price discovery and lead to a fall in the time and cost of issuances.'
p22628
aS'When will the IPO market see a significant revival?'
p22629
aS'IPOs have a longer lead time.'

p22641
aS'Another contentious area is the royalty paid by Indian subsidiaries of multinationals.'
p22642

p22643
aS'In a June report titled \'Less is more\', Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory firm, wrote, "The revised Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement and in some instances the Companies Act, prohibits controlling shareholders from voting on related party transactions, while allowing public shareholders to vote.'
p22644
aS'This makes their vote far more valuable.'
p22645
aS'This means public shareholders can now impact the outcome by vetoing transactions that they believe are unfair."'
p22646
aS'According to a definition given by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), "a related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a company and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged".'
p22647
aS"A 'related party' is a person or entity that is related to the company."
p22648
aS'"Parties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party, directly or indirectly, in making financial and/or operating decisions."'
p22649
aS'Thus, the definition of related party is wider than ever.'
p22650
aS'It also includes entities related to a company if they are members of the same group, if one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other and if both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.'
p22651
aS"Under the new rules, Sebi requires that all existing 'material' related party contracts or arrangements as on the date of the circular which are likely to continue beyond March 31, 2015, to be placed for approval of the shareholders in the first general meeting subsequent to October 1, 2014."
p22652
aS'Consultants said key challenges for companies include identifying related parties who fall under the new definition, updating and maintaining the database of such persons or entities.'
p22653

aS'Reliance Industries (Rs 57,584 crore), DLF (Rs 19,368 crore) M&M (Rs 17,105 crore) and Tata Steel (Rs 12,316 crore) topped deals with arms.'

p22670
aS"Edited excerpts:\n\r\nHow do you read today's policy?"
p22671
aS'The policy is very much in line with expectations, with the governor saying that anchoring inflation is the top priority.'
p22672
aS'The work done so far has made the 8% inflation target seem easy but the 6% target is where the expectations are anchored.'
p22673
aS"The monetary policy can achieve 8% inflation target but for the 6% target the central bank will need government's support."
p22674
aS'Government policy translating to a pickup in investment and addressing supply side issues will bring confidence.'
p22675
aS'Are there still upside risks to inflation?'
p22676
aS'The governor has clearly said that we need to be aware of geopolitical risks.'
p22677
aS'Even though none has materialised as yet, he is guarding the economy from those risks.'
p22678
aS'As a result, he is going to be on the 6% inflation target.'
p22679
aS'For instance, the way commodity cycle has panned out is a positive for the Indian economy.'
p22680
aS'So as compared to last time, the risks are on the lower side.'
p22681
aS'While geopolitical risks and normalising of the US monetary policy will pave the way for future action, we believe today India is in a better position and far more resilient to face these changes.'
p22682
aS'Even though WPI has been encouraging, the CPI inflation continues to be worrisome?'
p22683
aS'By when do you do see the CPI easing?'
p22684
aS'There are two aspects to CPI.'
p22685
aS'One is the base effect play, which indicates that November would be the lowest point, with the CPI slipping tad below 7%.'
p22686
aS'Now in the subsequent three months we will see CPI trending lower with September at 7.1-7.2%, October could be sub-7% and November could be around 6%.'
p22687
aS'These are numbers because of the base effect, so there will market expectation and clamor for interest rate cut.'
p22688
aS'But a small reversal is likely going forward with March seeing a little over 7.5%.'
p22689
aS'So definitely 8% is achievable.'
p22690
aS'What according to you will prompt the RBI to go ahead with a rate cut?'
p22691
aS'Geopolitical ricks abating, US monetary policy normalisation not overly affecting the markets, recovery in investment cycle and food inflation trending lower will give RBI the confidence to go ahead with a rate cut.'
p22692
aS'Hence, a combination of structural measures are needed for a rate cut.'
p22693
aS'RBI has projected FY16 GDP at 6.3%.'
p22694
aS'Do you read that as a sign for the government to get its act together?'
p22695
aS'We believe that FY16 GDP is going to be around 6.5% because we see growth picking up as decision making and ease of doing business improves.'
p22696
aS'Its only a matter of time and one must remember that all the positives wont result into clear visibility within a quarter.'
p22697
aS'A lag of atleast two to three quarters will be there.'
p22698
aS'Do you see rupee depreciating in the near term due to global monetary policy?'
p22699
aS'On the liquidity front, we maintain that even if US is completely at the end of its taper we still have ECB and Japanese central bank continuing liquidity enhancing programs.'
p22700
aS"So, liquidity won't dry up."
p22701
aS'But the capital flows will be selective.'
p22702
aS'Even among the emerging markets, I would say India stands among the top three investment destinations due to strong government and  improving macro conditions.'
p22703
aS'With the improvement in Indian economy, India will attract capital flows which will limit the downside to rupee even as the dollar index strengthens.'
p22704
aS'So thats why I dont see the Indian currency visiting its August 2013 lows again.'

aS'As growing usage of electronic equipment has made e-waste management a major challenge in the country, all stakeholders should be held equally responsible for it, a report published Tuesday said.'

p22707
aS'In India, approximately 2.7 million tonnes of e-waste is generated annually, according to the report.'
p22708
aS'The report said that lack of awareness figures among stakeholders on the mandatory compliance requirement of the rules and the negative effects of improper handling and disposal of e-waste are alarming.'
p22709
aS"It also suggests introducing new business models to treat e-waste recycling as a profitable business opportunity, rather than a single stakeholders' obligation."
p22710
aS'"The report explores a shared responsibility model in which all three primary stakeholders - the producer, the generator (households and bulk consumers), and the local regulatory body (municipality) - share the e-waste management costs," a statement said.'
p22711
aS'The proposed institutional framework, the report said, will be centred on the concept of a PRO (Producer Responsibility Organization) - an entity which is intended to have the physical responsibility for the e-waste recycling mechanism by providing forward and backward linkages with all other stakeholders involved in the process.'
p22712
aS'"In order to finance the operation of the collection and recycling system by the PROs, it is suggested that the producers (manufacturers and importers) bear the part of the financial responsibility by contributing to a Producer Responsibility Fund that would finance the costs of the establishing," the report said.'
p22713
aS'The e-waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2011 in India are based on EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) concept.'

aS'From here, if the rally has to sustain, credit growth has to pick up.'
p22722
aS'The second leg (of the rally) for bank stocks, says Morgan Stanley, is when economic growth starts picking up and revenue momentum picks up - its not just about non-performing loans normalisation in this stage.'
p22723
aS'But this is not likely to happen in the coming months, as loan growth takes time to pick up.'
p22724
aS'Also, the investment cycle is not showing any meaningful signs of recovery.'
p22725
aS'The assumption is that there is a pent-up demand for credit, which will surface soon.'

aS'In FY15, analysts expect loan growth to be driven by working capital requirements, retail and small and medium enterprises.'
p22727
aS'In FY15, Morgan Stanley expects loan growth to be at 15 per cent.'
p22728
aS'However, if loan growth is closer to 12 per cent, earnings could be impacted by five to six per cent, says Macquarie Capital.'
p22729
aS'Many would argue that since nothing much has changed on the ground and credit growth falling below 10 per cent levels, a sustained increase in stock prices is not possible as stressed assets account for nearly 10 per cent of banking assets.'
p22730
aS'But the perception on this too is changing due to two reasons.'
p22731
aS'First, the hindrances to business were primarily due to the previous government.'
p22732
aS'Second, the gross fixed capital formation has rebounded.'
p22733
aS'Credit Suisse says: For three years, GFCF has been lagging consumption growth in India, exactly the wrong thing to happen in a supply constrained economy and a recipe for future inflation.'
p22734

aS'Therefore, whenever there is a high gap between the two rates invariably there will be migration of funds from savings accounts to FDs.'

p23438
aS'Yet, the lender continues to grow its bottom line at a higher pace than the system growth.'
p23439
aS'Analysts believe that one way that the bank can see a substantial improvement in Casa ratio is if the bank manages to grow their current account (CA) component as the economy picks up.'
p23440
aS'"In March 2013, the CA component of the bank was at 18 per cent, which has now slipped to 15 per cent at the end of the second quarter of this financial year," added the analyst.'
p23441
aS'Another reason analysts attribute the decline in the Casa ratio is to the slowdown in the corporate segment; the current account share of HDFC Bank has specifically suffered as the lender is a banker to major exchanges and corporates, say industry observers.'
p23442
aS'However, the bank is unfazed by the change in the ratio.'
p23443
aS'Casa is an important tool but one also needs to look at the core margins of the bank which has remained stable in a range of 4.2 to 4.5 per cent for some time now, added Jagdishan.'
p23444
aS'HDFC Banks peers in the same period have been improving their Casa ratio.'

p23449
aS'Vaibhav Agrawal, VP Research, banking, Angel Broking, said though the ratio of Casa share to total deposits has slipped but the total deposits of the bank have been growing.'
p23450
aS'The share of fixed deposits to total deposits has improved further and this has led to the share of Casa declining.'
p23451
aS'But the Casa growth for the bank continues to be upward of 20 per cent and, therefore, we are not particularly worried about it.'
p23452
aS'Experts believe that the differential rate of interest rate on savings account balance and the slowdown in the corporate segment has led to the peers improving their Casa ratio share in the past few quarters.'
p23453

aS'It is also within the ambit of the medium-term approach of creating large global banks that can scale up and become globally competitive.'
p23592
aS'What are the issues thrown up by bank mergers?'
p23593
aS'First, RBI should be watchful of such mergers.'
p23594
aS'The reason is simple.'
p23595
aS'On one hand there is demand for more bank licences which has led to the creation of new banks with more to follow.'
p23596
aS'While RBI is to soon start allowing smaller varieties like payments banks, there were over 20 applicants when the window was opened last year which has led to two of them being given permission.'
p23597
aS'The broader issue is it should not be that someone creates a bank only to sell off later at an attractive valuation as our banking paradigm is based on both creating new banks and consolidation.'
p23598
aS'Therefore, we need to have some checks to ensure that those entering the filed have a long-term commitment.'
p23599
aS'When licences are issued for payments banks, this consideration should be kept in mind.'
p23600
aS'Second, curiously with ING Vysya being bought up, there is a coincidence of the tendency of more new private banks being up for sale.'
p23601
aS'It started with Times Bank, followed by the collapse and subsequent takeover of Global Trust Bank.'
p23602
aS'Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab too were sold out, which means that besides the institutional led new private banks, Indus Ind (owned by an industrial group), Yes Bank and Kotak Bank would be the players in this set of banks.'
p23603
aS'DCB would be the other player in this field that got converted to a new private bank.'
p23604
aS'Third, any bank merger would ultimately mean loss of jobs, especially at the senior level where there is an overlap in portfolios.'
p23605
aS'While other staff can be redistributed, the senior positions would be in jeopardy as there cannot be two heads of any business, and while a second level can be created, there has anecdotally been a migration of staff away from the acquired entity.'
p23606
aS'Also, invariably the acquiring bank tends to keep the jobs unless there are specific segments where the acquired bank has a dominant presence.'
p23607
aS'But, in this case, given that we are looking at the entry of more banks into this space, this could be good news as experienced banking professionals could move across laterally.'
p23608
aS'Fourth, the cost of a merger is also quite high and complex.'
p23609
aS'Besides realigning designations and salaries of staff across two banks, there would be a need to reconsider the duplicity of branches, and ATMs, which is the physical infrastructure, would have to be realigned.'
p23610
aS'Also, interest rates need to be aligned on deposits and depending on the current level of variation, the cost would vary.'
p23611
aS'Fifth, cultural integration is a major challenge for any merger as even two private banks will have different cultures.'
p23612
aS'This starts from how one addresses one another to the work culture which can swing between late hours to a more organised professional approach.'
p23613
aS'This is beyond other factors in the realm of technology which would definitely have been addressed given that all banks are now on the core banking solution that allows seamless flow of transactions across banks and the clearing system.'
p23614
aS'But training would be another area to look for as the level of expertise has to be harmonised across the two entities.'
p23615
aS'If such integration is not brought about, there would be a tendency again for the attrition levels to increase.'
p23616
aS'Sixth, such a merger would set the tone for further such action as the niche banks would become potential participants as they do have strong presence in their geographies and hence become the ideal fit for the larger banks looking for inorganic expansion.'
p23617
aS'To give an example, when Bank of Madura was taken over by ICICI Bank, it increased the latters presence in the southern region.'
p23618
aS'A strong bank looking for this mass can look at such niche banks, which are well run, as possible takeover ideas.'
p23619
aS'Even in case of the Kotak-ING Vysya, there is a strong southern territory as well as SME base which has been acquired by the acquiring bank.'
p23620
aS'At another level, some of the niche banks could introspect and review their prospects in the future given these changing equations.'
p23621
aS'In fact, several of them with a strong priority sector lending portfolio would be attractive for potential buyers.'
p23622
aS'Seventh, the same holds for public sector banks too.'
p23623
aS'There has been a lot of discussion on the merger of such banks.'
p23624
aS'Here, of course, the motivation is different as the ownership remains the same.'
p23625
aS'But there has been a strong voice for merger of smaller banks with bigger ones, with the SBI associates being high on the agenda.'
p23626
aS'While such mergers will take time given the complexity of the issue, as unlike for private banks where commercial and shareholder interests supersede those of employees, the same does not hold for PSBs as closure of branches and redeployment of staff in large numbers would be a logistical issue that will have a lot of opposition.'
p23627
aS'With the current merger giving Kotak Bank a considerable size, the idea of mergers could be opened up for serious discussion among these banks now.'
p23628
aS'Therefore, bank mergers, which will dominate the banking canvas in the times to come, will help the system leverage the advantages that go with size and synergies.'
p23629
aS'At the periphery, there will be some pain given that the status quo is shaken in any such arrangement.'
p23630
aS'With several challenges of size, capital, coverage, inclusion, competition, global presence, viability, etc, bank mergers appear to be the new order.'
